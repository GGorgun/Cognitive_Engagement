(ie, human beings are physical creatures as much as mental; in refusing contact, in lieu of providing an example of an appropriate non-sexual physical boundaries, what example are we providing them for negotiating those boundaries?) \\n  - Is it potentially unhealthy to overload students with an increasing amount of information?\\n  - How do we shift the attitudes of under-engaged students toward learning and believing in their own abilities?\\n ,\\n8,20,1,Hey everyone, \\n  I found a video on youtube that displays some pretty absurd abacus skills by students in Tokyo, Japan. \\n  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIiDomlEjJw\\n  What does everyone think about this video? Do you think we should teach math more like this in Ontario or even Canada? You have to admit, it\\'s pretty impressive how quick their abilities to perform mental math are. There are definitely pros and cons to how they teach math in this video. Let\\'s discuss! \\n  Incase you don\\'t know what an abacus is, or if you want to learn about non-math related uses for the abacus, here\\'s another link I found. I found it to be quite informative. \\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsLEj3Lfkd8\\n  Joe\\n ,\\n8,21,1,Hi Jim, I am a J/I student...I was just wondering if you can take your elective during the spring or summer of your second year? If so, would it be wise to do so?\\n  Thanks in advance,\\n8,22,3,Hi everyone, how\\'s it going?\\n  I edited the Elementary Year 1 calendar to reflect only our 2013 J/I classes and due dates, so if you want a more customized schedule to print out, it\\'s attached here.\\n  It doesn\\'t include teachables or group presentation dates, and there\\'s a chance it might not be entirely accurate, in which case please let me know if you catch an error.\\n  Have a lovely night and see you tomorrow!,\\n8,23,1,I must admit that I am not impressed at all with this. 8 years of practice to perfrom decimal calculations? What is the purpose of doing all that? \\n  I am totally supportive of the use of drills in math as a tool to build fluency, but as soon as some fluency is achieved I would want the students to apply it to problem solving and abstract thinking.\\n  Personally, I don\\'t believe most students will need to know very advanced math in their adult life. However, I still think we should teach it because I view it as a tool to promote abstract thinking, problem solving, confidence and creativity. \\n  It is neat to be able to do some tricks with an abacus, but I would not subject my students to 8 years of repetitive practice to gain the olympic medal in calcuations.\\n  I wonder how comfortable the japanese students would be if we changed one parameter in their excercises - for exmaple, use base 8 or 16 instead of base 10. I guess it will force them to start thinking about the algorithms they are applying - they would not be able to rely on their instincts anymore. \\n  Zack\\n ,\\n8,24,1,This is great, Laura. Thanks!,\\n8,25,1,In my opinion:\\nIf they are meant for reading at home, please provide online copies only.\\nIf they are meant to be used for discussion in class it is helpful to have a hard copy.\\n  Zack,\\n8,26,1,Thanks for catching that, Limin! \\n  Sorry folks - here\\'s a new version with the updated Math dates. And the English teachable has been removed. \\n  Laura,\\n8,27,1,Personally, I like to have a paper copy in front of me when I am reading as well, so if it was electronic, I would still print it off at home and kill the trees :P\\n  But maybe we can just do a tally next class to see who would want printed copies in the future or not so you dont end up printing off too many or too little,\\n8,28,1,Since we will be dealing with problem solving next class, I thought that this video would be appropriate to share with the class:\\n  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj2NOTanzWI\\n  This video sure comes across as a genuine/serious class aid doesnt it.  I think that it is a commentary on how students are taught not to question what is taught by the teacher.  Behind the dry humour, I think that this video, in particular, can be used to break these barriers and to help them become their own opinionated (always questioning) people.  \\n  At the beginning, it takes some time to realize that the answers are incorrect and that the facts are skewed, but you need some sort of background knowledge of problem solving and numeracy to realize this within the video.  Determining the capabilities of the students you are showing the video to is vital.  This can be a great critical thinking excercise to start a lesson or even the year off on in math.  In fact, I think that I may use this video to formulate my mini challenge in social studies class to show how you can encorporate critical thinking into a lesson...haha, I just realized that this is a relevant critical thinking tool, oh man, awesome, now thats critical thinking at work!,\\n8,30,1,Thanks so much Laura! This is a great help.\\n  See you Monday,\\n  Alex!,\\n8,31,1,A neat way to use mistakes as a lever of learning:\\n  http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment-authentic-relevant-lessons-video\\n ,\\n8,32,1,Hi - I\\'m definitely a paper person, and I find it takes an inordinate amount of time when classes require that we go online, download and print for every class, so I would definitely appreciate them being provided in class.  ,\\n8,33,1,Paper please!,\\n8,34,7,IMO learning about the abacus would be most fruitful for only one or two classes, after which you reach a point of \"diminishing returns\". The kids\\' fingerwork impressed me the first time, but I think it\\'s not much different from how accountants or cashiers seem to have an extraordinary knack for mental math, or how a computer programmer/gamer\\'s ability to touch-type is pretty much implicit memory--generally, if you spend enough time practicing any task, it becomes more innate. These kids are essentially practicing to use manipulatives just as some of us used base 10 blocks when I was in elementary school.\\n  Yes, when I was in elementary school, base 10 blocks were only used to teach me what basic operations (+,-,x,/) mean. But once you knew their meanings, you\\'d move to calculating on paper (i.e. written notation) and later on, digital calculators, because it\\'s more efficient to do so than to stack blocks. It seems like the abacus is the Japanese counterpart to paper and pencil and base 10 blocks. It\\'s like a 2-in-1 teaching tool and calculator. Some westerners similarly have an easier time doing mental math when they pretend to write out the calculation on an imaginary paper with their index finger (though not to the proficiency of the kids in the video). Otherwise, the western equivalent to the abacus would be being able to manipulate blocks at record speed. Rather than spending the time to develop that muscle-memory and develop the necessary mental pattern-recognition system, kids who already understand basic operations should probably focus on practicing applying them to problem solving contexts.\\n  On the other hand, though, I think the abacus would be great as an introduction to a lesson on algorithms, seeing it as a sort of \"analog calculator\". As well, it\\'s a nice example of bringing culture into math. Another example would be the Lattice Method of multiplication (according to Wikipedia, it\\'s of Persian origin), which is highly inefficient, but, in the rare instance that it\\'s taught in a western classroom, nicely gives kids exposure to different ways of carrying out operations (and different algorithms).\\n  -Cak,\\n8,35,3,Mathematical fluency...I\\'m not sure about fluency in terms of understanding the language of math, but I think it\\'s more a matter of repeatedly going through the finger motions and reinforcing its association with certain visual cues. With practice, the combined finger movements and visual cues becomes encoded in the brain as some meaningful, higher order construct (a pattern, essentially). A bit like--as addressed last class--how some students can memorize multiplication tables and recite multiplication statements, but still not understand what those statements/the concept of multiplication actually means. That\\'s not to say that the Japanese students don\\'t understand the math, but that it\\'s possible to accurately learn the abacus algorithms and do operations without understanding what the abacus pieces mean.\\n  I\\'m not sure about the neuroscience involved hereafter (this would be Wassim\\'s expertise)(and with just about everything I feel like I have to look for reductionist explanations), but I feel that memory recall is more potent when you\\'re acting something out instead of imagining it happen. Maybe they needed to move their fingers simply because abacus pieces don\\'t move by themselves, and that adding finger movements makes the problem-solving setting feel more as if they had the actual abacus in hand. Somehow I\\'m still open to the possiblity that finger movements have nothing to do with the actual mathematical problem-solving process, but more as a pattern-recognition/recall aid or even a security blanket. As removed from pedagogy as that sounds, I think it\\'s plausible assuming the students never had any exposure to other calculation tools.\\n  -Cak,\\n8,36,2,I love xkcd comics--I thought this one was very relevant to our 72 - 46 = 26 Gallery Walk and discussion about understanding operations and evaluating the process vs. final answer.\\n  \"Handy exam trick: when you know the answer but not the correct derivation, derive blindly forward from the givens and backward from the answer, and join the chains once the equations start looking similar. Sometimes the graders don\\'t notice the seam.\"\\n  If image doesn\\'t display\\nhttp://xkcd.com/759/ (roll mouse over image for the caption)\\n  -Cak,\\n8,37,2,I found this blog last year, and the teacher talks about an activity she uses to teach about equity in her classroom. Now, whenever I think of equity and equality, I think of this activity. I really like it - especially for younger kids (maybe juniors). \\nI don\\'t know if anybody else will like it, but I thought I would share it anyways since we talked a bit last class about equity and equality. \\n\\nThe link isn\\'t working, so I just copy and pasted what the teacher wrote. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Difference Between \\'Equity\\' and \\'Equality\\'\\n  Pay attention, folks, because this lesson is important. It\\'s important for feminism, for humanity, for respect and tolerance. So read closely, because I don\\'t get this fired up over nothing.\\n\\nThere\\'s this activity I do in my class. All the students sit in a circle, and I ask everyone to take off his or her left shoe and throw it into a pile in the center. Once the shoes are all piled up, I begin re-distributing them, one to each student, completely at random. Then I tell everyone to put on the new shoes. And inevitably, there begin the complaints.\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t my shoe!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s too big!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s too small!\"\\n\\n\"This doesn\\'t fit me!\"\\n\\nWhatever the specific complaints are, very few students are actually happy with their newly mismatched pair of shoes. \"What\\'s wrong?\" I ask. \"I did everything fairly. You all have two shoes - one for your right foot and one for your left.\"\\n\\n\"But Miss David,\" they say, \"they aren\\'t the correct shoes!\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" I say. \"You want the shoes that are best for each of you individually? Not just any shoe I find?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" they all say.\\n\\n\"But,\" I say, with furrowed brow, \"that doesn\\'t seem fair. I wanted to treat you all EQUALLY.\" I point to a boy with somewhat large feet, and a nearby girl with smallish feet. \"He\\'ll have more shoe than you will,\" I note. And without a doubt, someone unknowingly gets right to the heart of the issue:\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter who has more shoe, Miss David. It matters that we all have the rightshoes for us.\"\\n\\nAnd THAT, my friends, is the difference between equity and equality. Equality means everyone gets exactly the same outcome - two shoes - without regard to individual differences - large or small feet, for example. Equity means everyone gets the same quality of outcome - shoes that fit their individual needs.,\\n8,38,1,Is anyone else having trouble getting the curriciulum and other documents off of blackboard?

I\\'ve been looking around Blackboard but I can\\'t see anything relevant.\\n  Migrate to Pepper.  Please.,\\n8,42,5,When I was in elementary school, all the cool kids played Number Munchers (1990). Before school, during recess, during class, after school, in their dreams...the daily ritual of controlling that green head-on-two-legs through a flurry of mental mathematical expressions was your one-way ticket to street cred. I still wonder exactly what it was that made this game almost iconic of math learning in the 90s.\\n    Even more successful than Number Munchers was the Math Blaster (1994) (and later, everything Blaster) series that featured cardboard cameos of the green astronaut at just about every Business Depot and Computer City around. The creators split each game into adventure \"episodes\", so that even if you\\'ve had your fill of arithmetic you still wouldn\\'t mind going through yet more rounds just to save some celestial object from evil annihilation. The 3D graphics in Math Blaster 2 sealed the deal for me.\\n    Lastly, my favourite of these three games, the Logical Journey of the Zoombinis (1996) wasn\\'t as mainstream as the other two, but the amount of time I spent playing it was just obscene. As the title suggests, it\\'s a game of logic and deductive reasoning. The math aspect isn\\'t very apparent, since there are no numbers involved--finding patterns is how you\\'d be able to complete the game (rescuing all 625 zoombinis). This game isn\\'t as childish as others during its time, it can get really challenging, the plot is pretty decent for an educational game, it has a high replay value, and the overall game design is really clever. A lot of the graphics/character interactions remind me of the nonsensical side stories you see in Where\\'s Waldo books.\\n   ,\\n8,43,1,We\\'re all in the same boat :|\\n  No one could seem to find anything besides the course outline and \"Issues to consider\" docs,\\n8,44,2,Hey all.\\n  This is the forum inwhich we\\'ll be discussing the 5 articles that are to be read.

In fact, the first step of teaching students to be culturally aware is for teachers themselves to be culturally aware! Respecting cultural diversity is not only a cornerstone in community-building, but also a way to make material relevant to students. Every student brings with them their own story, and as educators, it is our responsibility to learn about their stories, our students as individuals, and celebrate them. As a group, we concluded that the way we incorporate cultural diversity would vary depending on our class and school community. For example, a community that is predominantly African-American would have different needs and therefore, different learning mediums, than a community that is diverse. Here are some ideas:\\n  • making material relevant to learners\\n-         achieve this by considering students’ interests and cultural backgrounds\\n-         e.g. History lesson: incorporate self-reflection questions, so as to connect course material to students’ cultural identities\\n• bridging life at home with life at school through parental involvement\\n-         e.g. parents writing letters to teachers about their kids or themselves\\n• teacher should be aware of boundaries\\n-         e.g. potential conflicts in dress code (religious attire and discomfort to students, which may further make them self-conscious about their culture)\\n• teachers should be attentive to planning special events on cultural holidays, etc.\\n• ESL students—electronic translators to communicate ideas,\\n8,52,2,  Society has always labeled adolescents in a stereotypical way. This stereotypical view of adolescents, and developmental stages in general, is cultural construction that is defined by each time period. We tend to see adolescents in a negative light: experimental, driven by hormones, rebellious, sloppy, animal-like, in search of their own identity, unproductive, and lazy. Through our readings, we realized the need to view each adolescent on an individual basis, not defined solely by age or developmental stage. Each adolescent has his or her own life-experiences, previous knowledge and cultural identity. We should recognize individual interests and integrate them into our teaching to make our material more relevant and engaging.  Our vision of teaching now includes a responsibility to get to know and understand our students and utilize this in our teaching strategies. We also have come to see that relationships are an important part of the teaching process. Relationships between teacher and students build a student’s relationship with learning. It is also important for teachers to understand the student’s relationships with peers and their family, which frames students’ identity and further reinforces the notion that adolescents are different from one another. Further, we as teachers should be aware of students’ interests and encourage students to pursue their interests outside of school. We should attempt to bring those outside interests into the classroom and school. For example, a student who likes to blog on their spare time can perhaps write a blog that represents their classroom or school adding to the community and at the same time deepening their interests. It has become clear through our group’s discussion that the need to recognize adolescents as unique individuals is necessary to the learning process and that treating adolescents as a group hinders learning.,\\n8,53,2,Yes, another xkcd comic, this time related to our discussion about \"dumbing down\"/simplifying material that we teach our students.\\n  \"This is a fun explanation to prepare your kids for; it\\'s common and totally wrong.

For example, when a student gives a correct answer, instead of just saying \"Yes, correct.\", you can ask questions such as \"Why is the answer correct? Do you have another example\", to invoke thinking. ,\\n8,55,1,The big ideas from today were: \\nactivating prior understanding and being aware of preconceptions\\nteaching from preconcieved notions\\nproviding oppurtunities for students to assess and monitor their thinking and learning (metacognitive strategies)\\nbuild a safe and inclusive learning enviorment where students feel free to make mistakes\\n ,\\n8,56,1,- be aware of students preconceptions\\n     - Fish is Fish\\n- metacognition is an important tool in the classroom\\n     - encourage students to think about their thinking\\n- build a safe classroom environment, where students feel comfortable making mistakes\\n- awareness of building upon a common foundation of knowledge\\n     - placemat activity\\n- the importance of presenting knowledge in an engaging way that is relevant to student interests/ other courses in the curriculum\\n- hands on activities can be a very useful tool to help students visualize, bring abstract concepts into concrete spaces, and allow for further understanding\\n ,\\n8,57,5,1) We have learned that everyone has misconceptions or previous knowledge that may influence their current learning process. As teachers, we need to discover and understand our student\\'s misconceptions so that we are able to determine their learning needs.\\n  2) As educators, it is our responsibility to promote metacognition in our students.\\n  3) It is important to learn with understanding and not just learning facts.\\n  4) The moon activity taught us that hands-on and visual activities can facilitate learning.\\n  Answers to our questions from last week:\\n- We know that you have an 8 year old daughter!\\n- We can use the Placemat Activity in our practice teaching as a reflective activity and to learn about students\\' prior knowledge.\\n ,\\n8,58,1,One thing that struck all of us was that even in applying theoretical principles well we can still fall short if we are missing what one of us has called \\'zing\\'. But we can deconstruct that \\'zing\\' and figure out what makes a teacher\\'s style, approach and personna engaging and irrelevat.\\n  Also, in identifying a students preconceptions, be aware that these are cultural/personal and are therefore sensitive. Those preconceptions shold be addressed with sensitivity.\\n  Frogs must understand that fish are limited in what they can understand depending on their experience and be explicit and detailed in their teaching.,\\n8,59,1,What are the big ideas (key learnings) from today?\\n  - creating a safe and comfortable environment where students can explore their ideas, preconceived notions and bias without fear of being wrong or being embarassed infront of their classmates\\n- educators need to recognize that all students have preconceived notions that can effect their understanding of topics and that in many cases even if students are taught the right answer they still hold strong to their prior beliefs (as outlined by Heather in the video)\\n - mental set\\n- ask the right questions to get real answers\\n- make sure to capitalize on what students know as each student has his/her own set of knowledge that needs to be considered\\n- \"meet students where they are\" in their learning, be sure not to make assumptions on what students know (for example, how the earth rotates, etc. in the video)\\n- use hooks, like placemats, to get into subject matter and assess what students already know or their interests\\n    Thanks! It was a great class. \\n  Heather and Michelle\\n     ,\\n8,60,2,Key learnings:\\n- we should meet students where they are, getting a picture of their preconceptions\\n- we should also challenge those preconceptions, encouraging metacognition as a way to scaffold learning.\\n- it\\'s important to teach knowledge that is transferable across domains\\n  No answers, but more questions:\\nCan we push past developmental barriers? (do they exist?)\\nAre there limits to understanding at particular junctures?,\\n8,61,3,1)\\n  - Fish is Fish - Children (and adults) have preconceptions of concepts that influence our thinking. These preconceptions are very hard change once they are ingrained in the mind.\\n  - Really digging helps people to uncover their own beliefs and verbalization help instructors to understand those conceptions or misconceptions.\\n  2)\\n  - I am understanding that a teacher that is kind and warm to their students will can encourage students to be more engaged in their own learning. \\n  - Also you can be textbook perfect, but still be boring to ones students.\\n       ,\\n8,62,1,-What are the big ideas (key learnings) from today?\\n  1)  A child is not simply an open vessel.  They come into the lesson with a preconceived notion of how things should be.  It is up to the instructor to unearth these notions.  One way is through open ended questions and activities such as the \"place mat\" activity.  Students should be given the opportunity to gestate and explain their thoughts (metacognition). \\n  2) When teaching one concept, the teacher should try to filter out things that may come up which are not relevant to the topic.  Then, the topics should be built upon in a scaffolding method and joined together in a cohesive, interconnected idea.\\n  -Were any of your questions from the previous class answered or addressed?\\n  One of our previous questions was \"How can we apply cognitive research to teaching?\". It was evident from the readings that research, and the resulting findings, can be applied to learning. For example, studies show that tying two subjects together will increase consolidation.  More specifically, simply teaching borders in geography will have a low level of retention. Teaching the reasons for the borders (even if not part of the government requirements) will highly increase retention, and thus retrieval of the information.,\\n8,63,1,Where?,\\n8,64,1,Drawing on examples from all of this weeks\\' readings, I think the most effective tool in generating a middle school program that values the adolescent learner is one that looks at each student individually rather than a program that relies on preconceptions about what an \\'adolescent\\' learner encompasses or is capable of. One of the main themes that I picked up on from this weeks\\' readings was the importance of building individual relationships. In the case with Mac for instance, the 14 year old African American boy, the only reason he was able to express his point of view was because the teacher was genuinely interested in his perspective and understanding where he was coming from. A teacher who was less concerned with indivudal relationships may have written Mac off as an aggressive, misbehaving child and not taken the time to understand that he was reliable and trustworthy. A deeper look into Mac\\'s experience at home and in his community at large made the teacher realize why Mac was behaving the way he was. This example compared with the student whose family recently immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic for example, is a demonstration of how getting to know your students can be very effective. In the case with the girl from the Dominican, her teacher did not take the time to understand her experiences at home and in the community which likely would have contributed to a very different understanding of what this student was capable of.,\\n8,65,7,Bahahaha, Commodore 64s...I was on the Macintosh Classic in grade 3. I remember my classmates and I were just captivated by font faces--a totally cool, new concept to us--and we printed our essays entirely in Cookie Hollow.\\n\\nIf introducing new material to younger students, I\\'d stay away from games or most things digital since the gameplay could be distracting from the math. Even if it weren\\'t distracting, digital media is inherently more \"removed\" from the student than hands-on learning or arguably even teacher transmission. There\\'s something about being able to manipulate base 10 blocks or plastic pizza slices with your own hands that enriches a student\\'s understanding of, say, addition/subtraction of fractions. If you were to click and drag manipulatives or \"solve for x\" on a computer screen, there\\'s a bit of a \"then a miracle occurs probably because that\\'s what the programmers intended\" feeling; if you can compose music, read the news, or slingshot an angry bird at a pig with just a click of a mouse, then my guess is, psychologically, the \"reward\" of mouse-clicking your way to 3/4 + 1/2 of a pizza = 5/4 of a pizza is suppressed. There may even be no reward because the computer can\\'t distinguish between haphazard clicking around by a bored student who happened to land the right answer and careful, thoughtful calculation by the determined student. In other words, the computer program can only verify final answers, but not validate the process (at least not that I\\'m aware of). But with real-life manipulatives, you know that the new shape or quantity that you formed by joining blocks/pizza slices together is a true instance of addition by virtue of your hands actually adding pieces together. The combined result--the actual sum--should feel bigger and heavier in your hands, and you can communicate your findings with your teacher.\\n\\nBut as for drilling math (which I\\'m a huge believer in), and assuming you have a thorough enough understanding of the concept, I think games are great! I think Number Munchers works well because it\\'s very simple, intuitive and gives constant and instant feedback. If you eat the wrong mathematical expression, you die. As well, you don\\'t have much time to think or examine each expression since you have cannibalistic bad guys chasing you...kinda like Pac Man with math. I feel that Math Blaster was a lot more slow-paced and favoured plot and character development over math drilling. In fact, I\\'d probably argue that Math Blaster isn\\'t a very good math practice tool because (even if it engages students with its space theme and adventure story) it just doesn\\'t ask enough questions for students to actually attain mastery of the math, so the math becomes secondary to the game. In Number Munchers, math IS the game. You\\'d have to spend around 5 minutes jet-packing through a cave to solve 9 or 10 equations in MB, while you can solve the same equations in NM in 30 seconds. Again, assuming that the student is comfortable with the material, I think the time pressure of NM would be appreciated. Given the limitation that MB\\'s gameplay is only as fast as its plot, I\\'m not even sure what its developers intended for their audience. Learning? Drilling? Just an appreciation for math?\\n  They should release Number Munchers as an iPhone app. Don\\'t even rework the graphics and audio, just stick with version 1.1!

We recognize that most adolescents are developmentally fragile and on the threshold between childhood and adulthood; the Lesko and Nakkula articles linked these fragile moments to specific psychological theories (Recapitulation Theory and Erikson respectively).\\n  This has made us realize that the teacher’s role in the adolescent classroom is more critical than ever.  During these years students are not only coping with hormonal, social, emotional, and possibly behavioural changes – they are also concretizing their identity; a developmental stage that will become the bedrock of their adult identity.  We as teachers need to recognize this and actively nurture this development.  If our classrooms promote caring relationships, high expectations, and inclusive participation, then we encourage students to think for themselves and become independent. (From the Bonnie Benard article)\\n  It is also important to note that students may not necessarily be treated equally, but they must be treated equitably.  An English Language Learner (ELL) adolescent is likely to be undergoing the same challenges facing a native English speaker, and thus their identity development is equally as important to respect.  One way to do this may be to openly acknowledge their cultural background and find ways to incorporate their language into the classroom; this has the double-edged benefit of exposing other students to that culture and encouraging pride in themselves.,\\n8,82,3,  One possibility that arose, having seen it attempted before, was the idea of a genuinely cross-curricular program.  The school year would be divided into terms or semesters each having their own them, perhaps based around a relevant current or school event (e.g. Earth Month, the Olympics, school musical/play) or a more abstract idea (e.g. What’s in Your Neighbourhood, Go the Next Mile).  Class content and assessments would then be linked to and surround these cross-curricular themes.  For example, a term surrounding the school musical could incorporate strands from the Arts and English, but depending on the subject matter may also include Languages (if a multi-lingual production), History/Geography, Phys. Ed, and others.  We wondered whether such a scenario might be more feasible in a public or private school – both must operate within a framework, but perhaps one setting is more suitable for a cross-curricular program than the other.      \\n  Another possibility, and one that is far more practical, is to incorporate multicultural elements into the classroom on a regular basis, either as part of a formal classroom content (e.g. open-ended assessments) or on an informal basis (e.g. World Holiday Calendar).  In the case of formal assessment it is important to remember to define the criteria and maintain a framework while still permitting student choice.  Also, there is difference between a classroom that is culturally responsive (i.e. one that promotes respect and awareness) and one that is culturally irresponsible (i.e. one that inadvertently promotes other extremes).  Constant questioning is imperative, and the process of sharing also goes the other way – students need to hear as well as be heard. ,\\n8,83,4,Question 1:\\nIn reading Lesko, we identified one of the main points as being the negative aspects of considering middle students as being neither children nor adults; “they cannot go backward to childhood nor forward to adulthood”. The downfalls of this paradigm is that we dismiss learners in this stage and disvalue the worth of their thinking. By recognizing that this is a stage in itself, simply marked with an incredible increase in knowledge absorption and linking between these knowledge “islands” via critical thinking. With this latter mindset, it is easier to conceptualize critical thinking exercise and even more importantly fostering an environment where students are comfortable bringing ideas forward in a public forum to gauge thinking and thereby tweak the teaching to tailor it to individual students.  In addition, we believe there is great value in building relationships between the teacher and every individual student.  As this weeks’ readings highlight, a positive relationship between the teacher and the student allows for the use of personally meaningful and relevant information to be used as a teaching tool. \\nOne question that has arisen out of our discussion is how to work within in system, which is essentially standardized. This standardization is in many ways built upon generalizations about what adolescence is and has deep roots in the history of education in our society. Many of these roots, as Lesko points out, put adolescents in a box. In many ways this is opposite to a lot of the ways Lesko’s article is suggesting we approach teaching intermediate students.  We look forward to learning how to bridge these differences. It will be necessary to be aware of the kind of thinking that Lesko identifies as problematic as we read about, discuss, plan and engage in teaching.\\n  Question 2:\\n  Drawing on examples from this week\\'s readings, we believe that the most effective tool in generating a middle school program that values the adolescent learner is one that looks at each student individually rather than a program that relies on preconceptions about what an \\'adolescent\\' learner encompasses or is capable of. The reasoning for this is that who the student may be in the classroom may not reflect their identity in the community, where they came from, or the world in which they are being raised (these elements compromising the concept of culture).Part of \\'knowing students\\' is being aware of and understanding their whole identity, not just what is superficially observed in class. Education is not one-size-fits-all. Each class is firmly located in a time and place, and its activities, atmosphere, values and set of social-relational codes that make it unique relative to all other classrooms. As teachers, we have to connect with the communities we work in to understand what makes them unique, what troubles them and how they fit into the larger fabric of their cities. Ladson-Billings message of \"inserting education into culture, instead of culture into education\" means that we need to be a part of that culture first, so that the \\'inserting\\' makes sense, that it is organic, and that it is effective.\\nOne overarching theme in this week’s readings was accomplishing the above by building individual relationships. In the example of the student named Mac, the teacher cultivated a personal relationship with the student and was genuinely interested in his perspective and understanding where he was coming from. This enabled Mac to express his point of view. Had the teacher not bothered to establish these connections, Mac may have been written off as an aggressive, misbehaving child and time would not have been taken to understand that he was reliable and trustworthy.\\nHaving established that it is important to get to know students, we must address the ‘how’. As teachers we need to recognize the inherent uniqueness of each class and try to \\'construct\\' a classroom environment that is conducive to all students’ needs and allows them to feel safe, important, and successful. This will allow students to feel more comfortable participating, asking questions, and will ultimately, in the ideal setting, perform beyond their potential. It is only when we have reached this state of openness that a dialogue can be established in which the teacher and student can get to know each other, engendering the type of relationship that allows for success.\\nOnce that the students are comfortable in class and the dialogue has been established, teachers can use many techniques to optimize relationships with students including\"speaking to the parents, conducting home visits, and asking students during an activity what their hopes and dreams are for the future\".\\nHaving explained why it is essential to create a positive environment and get to know one’s students, let us briefly consider two examples.\\nToronto has a high number of immigrants which may be concentrated in certain areas. This results in schools that may be practically homogeneous in their ethnic makeup. Knowing personal information about students and not just the stereotypes can help you, as a teacher, teach a lesson on immigration based on the student\\'s own experiences: what drives people to move away from their native land, how the immigration process was conducted, how it is living in Canada and learning English. Something abstract to the students, such as immigration to Canada made by early Europeans, may not necessarily be as engaging or as relevant as it could be if it was applied to the experiences of the students and their families.  This constructivist approach could help answer some of the questions about where the students fit in the world and could also act as a bridge between the school and home (making it relevant).\\nIn the example of the student that immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic, we see that getting to know one’s students can be very effective. In her case, the teacher did not take the time to understand her experiences at home and in the community. Had this been done, she would not have been simply labelled as a poor speaker of English (and thus a ‘poor student’), but as an industrious individual who speaks a foreign language fluently and has good street smarts. This would have made her instruction more personal and she would have felt more invested in her own education (and likely more encouraged as well).,\\n8,84,1,To add on to Tanya\\'s response, I think that getting to know the individual first (sociocultural status) by perhaps \"speaking to the parents, conducting home visits, and asking students during an activity what their hopes and dreams are for the future\" is crucial in knowing how to conduct your class and form the lessons.  For example, there may be a large student base in your class from Korea.  Knowing personal information (not only the stereotypes) can help you as a teacher teach a lesson on immigration based on the student\\'s own experiences: what drives people to move away from their native land, how the immigration process was conducted, how it is living in Canada and learning English. Something abstract to the students as immigration to Canada made by early Europeans may not necessarily be as engaging or as relevant as it could be if it was applied to the experiences of the students\\' and their families.  This constructivist approach could help answer some of the questions about where the students fit in the world and could also act as a bridge between the school and home.\\n  In terms of reaching out beyond the basic curriculum, integrating programs and activities (mentoring, sports, music, or in Mac\\'s case \"Inventing the Future\") which requires a deep investment on the child\\'s part build upon who they are as individuals.  This enables the teacher to actively participate in where they are going, and who they are becoming.  These activities not only offer attainment of skills and career paths choices, but the ability to build relationships, and see who they are through those relationships.  When these kids are pushed to the limits, like in sports for example, their best will come through, as well as their worst, but this is vital in order to help them find out who they are as individuals.,\\n8,85,3,Hi Kim,\\n  I am having a difficult time figuring out how to use APA to source the \"How People Learn\" book.  Would you like us to source the website that is given to us on our syllabus, or would you like us to source the actual book?\\n  Also, do you want a reference page attached to our Papers, or is in text citation without a reference page sufficient?\\n  Thank you!\\n  Tanya ,\\n8,87,2,  Question One\\n  We are consistent with the article’s belief that we view adolescence as a stage of ‘becoming.’ This view was partially shaped by the reality that it is a physical developmental stage.  Additionally, we agree with the assertion that adolescents lack a ‘voice’ in our society.  This act of ‘becoming’ is partially compounded by the fact that Canada lacks a clear transition or ‘rite of passage’ during which one transitions from ‘becoming’ to ‘being’.\\n  In general, reading these articles impacted our views.  While we did not all resonate with the idea of the ‘primitive’ child, there were aspects of the articles that uncovered some of our underlying assumptions.  As outlined above, the belief in the act of ‘becoming’ was challenging and forced us to consider what exactly we believe ‘becoming’ means and whether that is a valid assumption.  Overall, we have reconsidered, but not rejected all of our assumptions.\\n  We agree that the past strongly influences our present treatment and teaching of adolescences. Of particular note was the following excerpt:\\n  ‘Colonialist conceptions of adolescence are embodied in policies which support and confirm the dependency of youth and the essential and permanent difference from adults encoded in age.’\\n  We will be intentional in our attempt to understand the context of our students’ ‘culture,’ recognizing that it is not the same as ours, and even not necessarily the same as each others.  It is worth noting that we still all believe that it is a stage of development, but it does not define their entire being. \\n  We will question whether students in our class have a true voice, and when we believe they are not being expressed, what we can do to facilitate those voices.  In our conversations, we were able to explore some of these strategies that we have been learning which could be applied to that goal.\\n  Question Two\\n  These articles gave us many ideas and conceptions of various culturally responsive middle school programs. At the heart of many of these strategies is developing caring and supportive relationships. Research revealed that a caring relationship with a teacher gave youth the motivation to succeed. A quality of a caring teacher is being socio-culturally conscious. This involves respecting views about diversity, encouraging student autonomy, learning about your students lives, their family make up, favorite activities and their concerns and strengths. One idea that we got from these articles was to have guest speakers from your student’s family and neighbourhood. This allows you to learn more about your students and demonstrates to them that you value their cultural heritage.\\n  Using appropriate instructional strategies was another idea we felt was necessary to implement in the classroom. This includes, providing background information in your student’s first language, encouraging the use of bilingual dictionaries and using simplified language during lessons.\\n  Students have shown to have higher levels of success and lower rates of problem behavior when they know that their teacher has high expectations of them. A natural outcome of a school that places high expectations on their students is participation. Meaningful involvement according to Benard is a fundamental human need. Schools that incorporate these opportunities are setting up their students to thrive academically and socially. ,\\n8,88,1,  Question One:\\n  Our preconceived notions of adolescence include: raging hormone, need friendly yet firm attitude and clear boundaries, rebels, a state of limbo, need to become young independent adults, time of a process of coming into your own. \\n  After having read Lesko and others we realize that many of these notions are based on dubious science and racist origins. In shaping a future view of adolescence we feel that we cannot generalize adolescents any more than we can generalize adults. As teachers we need to talk to our students, listen to them and get to know them. They are people, not an age group. \\n  Question Two:\\n  In order to recognize what is relevant to your students we need to know them, their culture, perspectives and interests. There is more than one “right approach” to making information relevant to the students, and ultimately we would have to know them to know what works. For example, we could centre learning around projects that the students would collaboratively work towards. These projects would involve creating something that the students can relate to. An example for such a project would be for the class to write and act a play. The topic of the play would depend on the background and interests of the class. Through such activity the students will examine what makes a good play, the various elements of various plays, read and compare other plays and decide what qualities make them exceptional or not. Learning as means to work towards a certain goal is more engaging than simply receiving information to do well on the test. Also, having the class work on a comprehensive project enables the demonstration of multiple intelligences and modalities.\\n   ,\\n8,89,1,Part of \\'knowing students\\' is knowing about and understand the place they live. Education is not one-size-fits-all. Each class is firmly located in a time and place, and its activities, atmosphere, values and set of social-relational codes must reflect that location. As teachers, we have to connect with the communities we work in, to understand what makes them unique, what troubles them and how they fit into the larger fabric of their cities. Ladson-Billings message of \"inserting education into culture, instead of culture into education\" means that we need to be a part of that culture first, so that the \\'inserting\\' makes sense, that it\\'s organic, and that it is effective.,\\n8,90,1,Part of \\'knowing students\\' is knowing about and understand the place they live.

We need to be aware that developmental psychological stages do exist, but also remember that adolescents are still people and individuals in time, even if their own identity is in flux.\\n  In regards to a vision of teaching, we need to carefully examine our own pre-conceptions about adolescents in the classroom and bridge and integrate our previous knowledge with what we observe.  This stresses the importance of a personal connection with the students, beyond the classroom and also as a member of a community, acknowledging that there is more to a student then what appears in the classroom. For example, Mac from the Nakkula reading was better understood once his background was explored.\\n  Furthermore as teachers, we must understand that adolescents - much like other non-dominant culture groups, ethnic groups or gender identities – deserve to be empowered and treated equitably.  Teachers must also continue to encourage academic excellence by setting high expectations and by creating opportunities for students to achieve these goals.  Some of the ways in which teachers can do this, can include: meaningful discussions, thought-provoking questions, and hands-on work.\\n\\nUnfortunately, though we have these views, most of society still sees adolescents as living “in transition” and write off adolescent experiences.\\n  Question 2\\nA culturally responsive middle school program values the adolescent learner\\'s life experience, despite society\\'s tendency to trivialize it or deem it simply \\'transitional.\\' Teachers in such a program are interested in their students\\' lives, and actively engage them by implementing culturally-relevant curricula, or reworking existing curricula to be more inclusive. One way to do this, Villegas suggests, is by incorporating historically ignored perspectives into a lesson formerly based on the dominant culture\\'s experiences. Students are also empowered by being able to share the practices and traditions of their own home lives in a safe, welcoming environment that explicitly recognizes a diversity of viewpoints as being beneficial to all.\\n  A diverse curriculum is emotionally and cognitively useful to the mind of the adolescent learner, preventing foreclosure by ensuring that students see the variety of options possible for their future. Thus, the ideal curriculum uses classroom materials – such as novels – that provide a varied set of types of characters to serve as developmental examples to the student.\\nTeachers must serve as advocates for their students, drawing on native language resources and building on students\\' interests outside school. In this way we demonstrate the importance of diverse experiences, raise expectations for students from low-status groups, and help to make schools more equitable for everyone.\\n  In addition to bringing students\\' cultures into the classroom, we must take care to unpack the cultural norms presented in school texts (eg. blowing out the candles on a birthday cake, or living in a house with a patio and backyard) to ensure that every student accesses the curriculum from an equal footing.\\n ,\\n8,92,1,http://mtliteracy2011.wikispaces.com/Welcome,\\n8,93,12,Our group first examined the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) Foundations for Professional Practice, which outlines expectations for Ontario public school teachers and comprises of the Ethical Standards, Standards for Professional Practice, and the Professional Framework (for professional development). Surprisingly, it was short and generalized--only two pages, and a far cry from the likes of the far more specific Illinois Professional Teaching Standards.\\n  We found the OCT Ethical and Professional Standards to be mostly common sense, though we understand the OCT’s need, as a semi-political body, for explicit and public expression of these standards. Nonetheless, we are concerned that the standards are neither enforced nor regulated, and that after the initial two-year probationary period, teachers are only assessed internally by the principal.\\n  Some school boards have mandated professional development sessions to ensure teachers\\' ongoing professional learning. One may argue that this is enough. For example, Anchor Charts are an increasingly predominant teaching strategy in TDSB schools, as learned in our CTL 7007 Authentic Assessment class.  However, the sheer human nature of some teachers makes it difficult to sustain and rekindle the initial spark of creativity, energy, and open-mindedness in the face of immense societal changes.\\n  We continued to investigate some UK and US teaching standards. Most American states require examinations to complete teacher certification. On one hand, this ensures conformity and convergence--at least initially--to prescribed standards in practices and pedagogical content knowledge. On the other hand, standardized testing may be too rigid to accurately assess classroom management and teaching strategies, let alone course content.\\n  The United Kingdom takes this one step further.  The national Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) continually evaluates teachers based on their attributes, knowledge, and skills. Three of the five performance statuses actually influence pay increases.  But would teachers neglect their classes in the effort to attain a higher level status? Anagnostopoulos et al. (2010) examined an American non-profit organization similar to the TDA and questioned whether the motivation for teachers seeking certification was “Dollars, Distinction or Duty”. They noted that opportunities for such teachers to take leadership roles and carry out initiatives in their schools varied too greatly to simply assume that certification begets improved teaching practice. \\n  Yet such leveled evaluations and assessments may actually motivate teachers to improve their teaching practice, or at least remain vigilant. After all, just as students should attempt to earn better marks by working harder or being more creative, if teachers had to answer to an external organization it may be a formative incentive to improve their teaching practice. \\n  Indeed, Beck, Hart & Kosnik (2002) concluded that although their surveyed sample of teachers already conformed to the tested teaching standards, there was always room for improvement, and teaching standards may be the very catalyst for better teaching practices all round.\\n  Sources\\n(OCT), Ontario College of Teachers (2010).

After having completed my Honours Bachelor of Science (Life Sciences), I decided that entering an accelerated nursing program was the next best step for me. Looking back, I did not realize the impact that decision could potentially make on my life, nor did I ever believe that two years of a nursing education would change my life forever. Since I was a young girl, it was in my nature to take care of and worry about people, listening to their needs, and always trying to do my best in helping them. Believing that a good nurse carried these qualities, I was excited to begin the program, and nervous for a new start all at the same time.\\n       The journey through nursing school at McMaster University is where I experienced major shifts in my development, cognitively, socially, emotionally, and morally. During my undergraduate education as a science student, I was accustomed to going to class in large lecture halls, listening to lectures amongst hundreds of other peers, and scribbling down never-ending notes. I figured that I tackled science, now let me tackle nursing – I would be fine!\\n       The first month was probably the biggest challenge in terms of adjustment. My peers and I understood quickly that the expected learning style was much different than any of us had experienced before. Learning took place in very small groups and was centered around the problem-based learning (PBL) approach, “...in which the learner is presented with a clinical situation or client story as a starting point for the identification of learning needs...the preferred method of facilitating knowledge acquisition” (McMaster University Undergraduate Nursing Program, 2007, 7). Class after class, I sat in small groups, talking out clinical problems, basing my words on prior research I had done the nights before. The process was, at times, mentally draining. I was essentially attempting to fulfil the second core learning principle in How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice, which states, “to develop competence in an area of inquiry, students must have opportunities to learn with understanding. Deep understanding of subject matter transforms factual information into usable knowledge” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000, 12). My depth of preparation affected my ability to participate in discussions and impacted the degree to which my peers learned. I did not want to let anyone down, and I especially did not want to miss out on my own learning, so I read continuously, jotted down ideas, and always went to class reading to participate. I ended up excelling at PBL. The way I was acquiring knowledge and learning was like never before! I was now a more active and participative learner, more curious and pensive than ever before. I had no choice but to learn the PBL approach, accept it, and practice it, for it was the basis of my hands-on practical work during my clinical rotations.\\n       During my clinical rotations I witnessed and experienced events that I never knew even existed – I saw life, death, and everything in between. I worked what seemed to be hundreds of 12-hour shifts, day and night. I was working with and learning from nurse preceptors, some positive and amazing, others dismissive, stressed, and horrible teachers. I worked with patients whom I cried and laughed with, and others who did not even open their eyes. I was journeying on an emotional rollercoaster, growing with maturity, with honesty, and most importantly, with courage (courage for me to continue and courage that I needed to instil in my patients when their days were darker than a black hole). I considered myself strong and I learned quickly that life was precious. Looking back today, I recall coming home after a long and tiring shift, not wanting to talk to my family and friends about my day. It would take me a couple days to unwind, mentally, before I could give them a glimpse of my nursing experiences. As a nurse, I learned quickly that critical self-reflection is what kept my feet on the ground. I submitted hundreds of self-reflections during nursing school. In these reflections, I would express my thoughts and emotions, my learning, and also my experiences. I was able to talk to myself, talk myself through my own experiences, and I was able to ask myself questions and then answer them at the same time. I was essentially practising metacognition which, “...often takes the form of an internal conversation...” (14), and this practice assists in creating transferable knowledge (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000). These reflections were very personal, exactly like a diary, and I experienced my shift in development twice over, in real-time and then on paper.\\n       I had incredible professors who continuously supported me through my nursing education and reflective practises. The supportive and tight-knit small group atmosphere supported my learning and my development into a nurse and more importantly, into a person who was thinking, seeing, feeling, and understanding much more than she had ever done before!\\n    References\\n  Donovan, M.

Thanks!,\\n8,99,8,  I experienced a shift in my approach to conflict resolution 10 years ago, at the beginning of my relationship with Guy, my partner.  I grew up in a family that literally enjoyed fighting. We tended to be as quick in raising our voices as we were in making peace and calming down. Often it was just a form of loud venting. Guy, on the other hand,  did not like fighting and would almost never raise his voice. When we first had disagreements I tended to raise my voice. Guy just remained calm and simply asserted that there was no need to shout. It was very strange to me and even made me angry – I could not enjoy the fight without a fighting partner. I realized that for the sake of our relationship I would have to learn to resolve conflicts differently.\\n  That realization alone did not help me remedy the situation immediately. I read some books about conflict resolution and started gradually applying new techniques I read about. It felt very awkward and unnatural at first, but Guy was very positive supportive. He used a lot humour to maneuverer out of confrontational situations and into working together towards a common goal. Eventually I grew more comfortable with my new repertoire of behaviours and even started applying them with my family.\\n  My transition can be explained in terms or operant conditioning. My tendency to fight to resolve conflicts was conditioned during childhood through positive reinforcement - It worked well within my family. As cited in Seifert (2011) operant conditioning can lead to intrinsic motivation, which can explain why I tended to enjoy fighting. I generalized my behaviour by fighting not only with my family – I tried the same behaviour with Guy. Guy`s responses were not as reinforcing as my families and gradually I went through a process of discrimination and extinction. Guy’s continual positive reinforcement helped shaping my new behaviour.\\nMy shift of thinking can also be explained in constructivist terms, as cited in Seifert (2011). I experienced a process of accommodation, revising my pre-existing concepts of how conflicts should be resolved. I also received instructional scaffolding from “experts” – Guy’s modeling of an alternative behaviour.\\n  Donovan et al. (1999, p. 10) mention the importance of engaging student’s preconceptions as a necessary prerequisite to learning. I can definitely relate to that. I was taught (but did not learn!) some conflict resolution techniques prior to meeting Guy, as part of some work training. Since the training did not elicit and challenge my preconceived notions of the best way to resolve a conflict, it had no real impact on my core beliefs and mental habits. In contrast, when I lived with Guy, I had the opportunity to experience the ineffectiveness and the negative consequences of my preconceived notions.\\n  Nowadays Guy and I rarely have fights. We occasionally have arguments, but most often we just have conversations, after which we often agree and sometimes agree to disagree.\\n  References\\nDonovan, M. S., Bransford J.

There are many times when the changes in my development were positive, but as suggested by Kevin Seifert (2008) “…less positive examples of respondent conditioning can happen as well” (Module 2). I think this is important to understand before beginning to teach in a classroom.\\n            When I was a child, I experienced a shift in emotional development while taking piano lessons. Instead of helping me to develop further and become more confident, this emotional shift due to respondent conditioning made me lose confidence and hate the piano.\\n            When I was eight years old, I began to take lessons at Arcadia Academy of Music. I enjoyed the lessons, and I loved listening to the instrument. I would practice on my keyboard at home, and I played at all of the recitals. Every week, I looked forward to the next lesson. My teachers were positive and enthusiastic, and they were always very friendly.\\n            When I was ten years old, my parents bought a piano for our house. It was an auburn baby-grand piano that sat in the living room, and when I played it I could see out the window into the front yard. The piano bench opened up, and I could keep my books inside. I loved to sit on the bench and practice. Soon after we bought the piano, I changed schools and signed up with the Royal Conservatory of Music. Instead of taking lessons in a classroom, a teacher would come over to my house and teach me at home. On the first day of lessons, the teacher rang the doorbell and entered my living room. She gave me new books and we began to play. With each passing lesson, she became meaner and meaner. When I would make a mistake, she would bang her fist on the piano and then put her head in her hands and sigh very loudly. If my hands were not in the correct position, she would grab them and poke my palms very hard with her fingers and scream “Apple in the hand!” so I would remember the correct way to hold my hands (as if I were holding an apple). If she knew that I was scared or upset, she would say, “Are you going to cry? Let me see.”\\n            Whenever I had piano lessons, I began to feel sick. I would get headaches and become nauseated. Eventually, even when I practiced at home by myself, I would feel the same way. Whenever I sat at the auburn baby-grand piano, the feeling would come back. One year later, I switched back to Arcadia Academy of Music and began taking lessons there again. Although the teachers were much friendlier, I would feel sick every lesson.  I had associated the piano with the feeling of being nauseous and the bad teacher. Shortly after, I quit playing the piano.\\n            Kevin Seifert  (2008) suggests that respondent conditioning describes changes in response to stimuli (Module 2). In this case, the Royal Conservatory teacher was the unconditioned stimulus. Whenever she banged on the piano, or yelled, it triggered an unconditional response and I would feel sick. Eventually, the piano became the conditioned stimulus, and whenever I sat at a piano I would have the conditioned response of getting nauseous. This response became generalized, and I would feel the same way while playing any piano with any teacher. During my lessons with the teacher from the Royal Conservatory of Music, I “learned” to hate and fear the piano. ‘           \\n            In How People Learn, Donnovan et al (2000) explains that children will come to the classroom with preconceived thoughts about a subject (p. 10). They will also, however, come with preconceived feelings surrounding different subjects or situations.  I think that it is not only important to understand their preconceived thoughts and try to deter any misconceptions, but we also must recognize their emotions, and try to make positive adjustments if necessary.\\n              References\\n                Donovan, M.

I see myself as a loving individual and one of my greatest joys comes from interacting with and getting to know people. I try to bring a positive attitude to any situation in life and always make an effort to pass kindness onto others. Being open to people has been a cornerstone of my personality for a long time. However, there was a period in my life, particularly during my youth, that these qualities were not prominent.\\n  I began my grade 4 year at a new school, Claude Watson School for the Arts. I remember feeling anxious, nervous, and excited for my first day and was eager to make new friends. The summer preceding the start of the new school year was a difficult time for me, as I had many close friends from the school that I was leaving and was sad to part ways with them. I had also spent the last few weeks of the summer at a sleep away camp – my first time being a camper and away from home. The time that I spent at this camp was not enjoyable. For the first time in my life, I found it difficult to make friends and couldn’t connect with anyone. The other campers in my cabin singled me out and teased me for being a high achiever in my swim class. I remember developing a thick skin and a quick tongue and these carried with me into the school year.\\n  The first months of grade 4 flew by and I got to know the students in my class very well. Thankfully, I got along with mostly everyone and made a few close friends. However, there was this one boy, Adam, that really got under my skin. He was always seeking attention, disruptive during class, obnoxious at recess, and annoying at lunchtime. Early in the year, we had been paired to work on an assignment together in class and we couldn’t agree on anything. We weren’t able to focus, didn’t complete the assignment, and as a result, received a horrible grade. I remember that as the year progressed, I teased him behind his back, excluded him at lunch, and even accused him of peeing his pants when he spilt Orange Crush on himself. My dislike for him peaked during one recess in the wintertime and concluded with me yelling, “You couldn’t even hurt a fly!” and pushing him down the playground slide. My actions got me into a lot of trouble and I was forced to speak with my teacher, the principal, Adam, Adam’s mother, and my mother in a meeting after school. I remember this meeting vividly; I cried so much. Adam also cried and confessed that he just wanted to be friends with me and that I had been so awful to him. I had no idea that I had hurt him that deeply and remember feeling guilty, sick to my stomach, and ashamed.\\n  This incident has always stuck with me because I see it as a defining moment in my character and my life. I realized that I had become the very reason that I was so sad during my time at camp and that I never again wanted to be the cause for another person’s sadness. I learned that my actions have consequences and that everyone deserves respect and understanding. The reason I recalled this story for the brief paper is because I believe that the student dynamic plays a critical role in teaching (Kosnik and Beck, 2011). I strongly believe that the cornerstone of my teaching philosophy is community; an environment in which students feel safe, welcomed, and respected must absolutely be established before any learning can happen (Kosnik and Beck, 2011). Reflecting on my experiences with Adam, I can only imagine how difficult it must’ve been for him to pay attention to our teacher after returning from a lunch period that involved 10 other students laughing at him for “peeing his pants”. Comparatively, I remember how difficult it was for me to pay attention in class with someone like Adam always seeking attention and disturbing me. It is the responsibility of the teacher to set the tone for the classroom, ensure that all students are respectful of one another, and make sure that student relationships are healthy and constructive. I know that this will always be a priority for me in my future teaching practices.\\n  On a side note, since that meeting with the school staff and our parents in grade 4, Adam and I have been best friends, racking up over 16 years of solid friendship. We currently live together in an apartment near Bloor and Ossington with another one of our friends. Adam enjoys film, soccer, and is one of the best guys I know. He still denies ever peeing his pants in grade 4, rightfully so, even though I still bring it up from time to time. Adam loves to drink Orange Crush and still sometimes spills on his pants.\\n  References:\\nBeck, C., & Kosnik, C. (2011). Teaching in a Nutshell. New York, NY: Routledge.,\\n8,104,3,  During my first year of university, I underwent many changes. I experienced social and cognitive shifts in my development. Socially, university was very different from high school. I was no longer living at home with my family in Toronto. Instead attending the University of Western Ontario, I lived in a communal residence in London with 3 roommates. I met many new people in my residence, class and on campus that I befriended and my core group of friends changed dramatically as it was difficult to keep in touch with some of my high school friends that lived in other cities. I was forced to become more independent. I was responsible for my own day-to-day living including preparing meals, cleaning my own residence apartment, grocery shopping, transportation to class, completing homework etc. I embraced this independence and I was excited to be living on my own. I believe the social shift I experienced, moving away from home for university helped shape who I am today.\\n  I also experienced a cognitive shift in my first year of university. I was now responsible for my own learning. My classes were made up of 700+ students with one professor who did not take attendance, tell me when to do my homework or when to study for exams. This differed so much from elementary and high school where my teachers and parents were so involved in my learning. In these large classes I did not feel that I was part of a community. Further, my professors did not address students’ pre-conceived notions. In How People Learn, Donnovan et al (2000) explain that students come to the classroom with preconceived thoughts about how the world works and that it is essential to engage these notions or else they will revert back to them when learning new and conflicting material. This same concept was reinforced the Harvard-Smithsonian video A Private Universe (1987) when Heather would not let go of her preconceived ideas about the phases of the moon. My professors did not address our preconceived notions nor use them to enhance their teaching. They simply lectured the pre-selected course material without time to slow down to take questions or evaluate what students were thinking about the material. Donnovan et al (2000) explain that students must have opportunities to learn with understanding. This deep understanding allows factual knowledge to become usable information. This was not part of my experience in my first year of university. The professor just relayed material for us to regurgitate on multiple-choice exams. Any information I learned was memorized and then forgotten after the exam, which meant it was not transferable across domains. There was no room for metacognition, as I was not thinking about what I was learning, I was just memorizing. There was also no room for professors to evaluate my thinking process, as all assessments were summative and counted for a huge portion of my mark. Professors also did not address diverse student needs. Lecture-style classes and multiple-choice evaluations do not account for different learning styles. After first year, I realized that I needed smaller classes with room for discussion and questions as well as varied forms of evaluations. I transferred to a program that accommodated my learning needs. The shifts I experienced in first year university were a product of my new living environment and learning environment. This was a great period of transition in my life.\\n\\nReferences\\nDonovan, M. S., Bransford, J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W. (Eds.). (2000). Key Findings.

Slowly I began removing myself from social settings; not physically, but emotionally. This change was shocking to my friends, my family and to me because I had always been the most outgoing, vivacious, happy young girl. But I was changing. I never was able to pin point exactly what triggered this change, this slow decline into a depression so lonely and complicated. It did not last very long, this depression spurt I mean, as I found myself happy again when I entered university. I had never taken pills for being “mentally unstable”, nor had I seen a therapist to talk me through my seemingly long and lonely second last year of high school. Strangely, and fortunately, I was fine.\\nThe heavy wave of depression had passed and I entered university the same bubbly girl everyone knew me to be. I do not think I truly regained all my character that I had lost in high school, but for whatever it was worth I was closer to being methan I had been in a long time, and so I just went with it.\\nAfter a couple of great years at the university of western Ontario, things made a turn for the worst. It was back. I was gone and my dark depression had swooped back in and consumed me, taking my place. Four year had gone by since the last time I was so empty. This time it was different. This time it was more consuming than ever before. Tactics I had used in high school to rid my mind of awful thoughts no longer worked for me as a university student. My friends did not get it. My schoolwork was compromised, my body was compromised and my mind was wholly compromised as well. For whatever reason, I couldn’t manage to find tactics that worked for me; to distract myself from my thoughts. Sometimes I felt so empty it was as though I had no thoughts at all. I was bare. I was no longer myself in anyway. Thing that usually made me happy made me feel nothing. Things that made me sad simply couldn’t compare to sadness I was experiencing. I was nowhere to be found.\\nSkip forward a couple years, and I was back. No, I am back. I can thankfully say that I managed to tackle my depression and rid myself of it. I saw psychiatrists, I took some anti-depressants, and most importantly I learned to refocus my thought and take control over my metacognitive state. In my mind, I was able to define my goals and the means by which I hoped to achieve them. I trained my mind to be more positive, to recognize that sadness is only relative; sadness is only a mixture of thoughts with a bad spin. Put a good spin on then, however, and you can turn some of that around.\\nI can honestly say that the person I am today is a mixture of the young girl I was before I first plunged into depressing, along with new insights, new optimism for life, and new metacognitive strategies that I take with me everyday, everywhere I go.\\nIn the article How People Learn, one thing stuck out to me as I was reading it, which trigged me into talking about this shift in my own development. That is, how certain metacognitive approaches ought to and can be integrated into the classroom in order to encourage students to take control of their own learning and of the strategies that work for them. I was able to adopt certain metacognitive strategies of my own that managed to control my thoughts, my way of thinking, and the positive spin I wished to take to influence my thoughts. \\nStudents need to be encouraged to develop their metacognitive thinking skills because frankly, even if it is of no use to them in the classroom, hopefully like me, they will find use for it elsewhere.\\n  References:\\nDonovan, M.

For three months, I lived in a small town in Northern rural Namibia with three other female students from U of T. We lived alone for the majority of our stay there and arranged volunteer opportunities, social activities, and recreational travelling on our own. Before having gone on this trip, I had always lived in Toronto and was comfortable and settled in my community; I found no need to engage in activities for the purpose of building new relationships and felt no drive to shed my identity as an introvert. I was so attached to this role that I maintained it throughout my developing years and young adulthood, remaining shy and hesitant to embrace new experiences and relationships, completely wedded to the static, quiet life that I had created.\\n  Needless to say, I was terrified at the prospect of leaving Toronto to live in Namibia. Namibia was a completely novel living situation where I would be unfamiliar with the culture, physical surroundings, language and people. I knew that by accepting the internship offer I would be putting myself in a socially uncomfortable situation. However, in learning to adapt to my new surroundings, I underwent a pronounced transformation from introvert to extrovert. I made a conscious decision while in Namibia to set aside the person that I was in the past, and learned to be someone that capitalized on opportunities, took initiative, disregarded one’s social fears, and was generally extroverted. My shift in thinking was supported very much by my external situation as an alien in a new environment: I knew that I had to be more outgoing and social during my short visit in Namibia in order to have a full range of experiences there. In that way, my circumstances and environment drove me to learn to change my attitude and persona, creating a drastically different experience for me in the way that I was perceived by my peers and interacted with my peers in my environment.\\n  According to Educational Psychology, this development in my social personality was a behavioural shift in my learning: operant conditioning to the positive consequences of my new social effort (as cited in Seifert, 2011). For example, I went to social events and was immediately “rewarded” with the outcome of positive social interactions with my peers. I then continued to exhibit the behaviour of being social to continue to receive this “reward”. My learned behaviour became more strongly associated with the positive consequences as repeated social efforts on my part resulted in stronger friendships and relationships – the “reward” became bigger, thus propelling forward my desire to be more social.\\n  This experience provides two insights that pertain to my future life as a teacher. Firstly, this experience clearly shows operant conditioning as explained above. This is a theory that can be used in the classroom to assist students in creating positive associations with learning in the classroom. Secondly, is the shift in personality that I underwent. We spoke briefly in our assessment course about how teachers each have a “persona” that they take on in the classroom. The process that I will have to undergo to discover and adopt this persona will be similar to the social transition that took place over the summer in that I will have to set aside some parts of my personality in order to become a teacher in the classroom. Over the summer I put aside my desire to be comfortable and my tendency to be shy and became extroverted and confident in new situations. As a future teacher, I will have to put aside my need to please others and my need to be liked, and will have to adopt a personality of someone who is authoritative, confident and commanding.\\n  Sources Cited:\\nSeifert, K. (2011). Educational Psychology. Houston (TX): Rice University. ,\\n8,107,2,  My First Year Woes\\n             Education follows a pattern of stages and transitions. Whether it be the transition from primary to junior, junior to intermediate, or intermediate to senior; each stage presents a shift in the developmental and educational approaches of each students learning abilities. Each transition imposes various adjustments, which may restrict or nurture their educational and developmental needs. This brief paper will investigate and discuss my transition period while beginning my first year of my undergraduate degree.\\n            The approach towards learning in secondary schools and universities are visibly disparate. According to the film “How People Learn: Introduction to Learning Theory (Session 1)”, students learn through first hand investigations. In secondary schools, this notion of learning is supported as students generally include materials and trials in their learning. According to the film, this hands-on approach is commonly followed by text (“How People Learn”, Detroit Public Television) . I benefited from this format of learning. This constructivist style of teaching was beneficial to my learning as it appeared as if I was making discoveries and findings independently. This independence was advantageous as it facilitated a sense of confidence through learning. Furthermore, this constructivist mode of learning promotes a level of individuality and freedom, while continuing to offer support and aid to students. My high school experience was a standard example of this style of learning. I learned most subjects with a general ease. I was confident in my studies and ambitious with my assignments. Following my high school graduation, my plan was to attend Ryerson University to study history. A number of my peers decided to take an extra year at high school, or travel abroad before attending undergraduate studies. Without and little consideration and no hesitation, I began my studies in history in September 2007.\\n            My first year of university was subject to struggle. I found difficulty in keeping up with the fast pace curriculum, the extensive readings and the overwhelmingly large class sizes. Additionally, the assessments offered little creativity and interaction. I was not forced to think for myself during my first year of university, I was encouraged to echo anything mentioned during lessons. This wasn’t useful to my educational development, which led to an increased stress with school. I felt anxious that I was not capable of completing university. My attitudes and esteem towards education and learning shifted towards a completely opposite direction. In retrospect, there are three reasons that could be linked towards this negative shift in my educational development.\\n            The first reason why this negative stint in education occurred was because I lost the ability to apply a first hand approach to how topics are connected.  Secondly, according to Kevin Seifert’s textbook “Educational Psychology” (2011), students must demonstrate a “readiness” in learning. Seifert (2011) explains that with older students, the concept of “readiness” is translated to the knowledge of prerequisites. This means that my knowledge prior to university was not sufficient to foster my learning during my first year of university. Finally, a final reasoning behind my original struggles in university reflects the mode of assessments. Grading was generally limited to short answer testing and final papers. The lack of diversity in assessments influenced my great shift in learning, as I had to learn new evaluation techniques. According to my prior experience, learning did not have boundaries as it could be performed nearly anywhere. In contrast, my university learning was limited to the two-hour one-dimensional lecture (Seifert, 2011). In summary, learning involves a number of stages, which offer various modes of teaching. Each method of teaching has their benefits, yet the adjustment between each stage leads students to experience an original struggle.\\n    References\\n  Darling-Hammond, L. (Director). (2003).

To date, the most drastic shift in my learning was transitioning from high school to university. I had to adapt socially, cognitively and emotionally. I struggled the most with the development required to my cognitive abilities. My previous learning styles needed to grow and change to compliment a student’s independent life in university.\\n  High school was a wonderful experience for me, both socially and academically. I loved school and the work that came a long with it. However, unlike many of my peers, I learnt in a different way, I had an Individual Educational Plan (IEP). At an early age I was identified as dyslexic. Consequently, there were aspects of learning that were more difficult for me, and as a result, I had to work harder to ensure the grades I wanted. I found some subjects more challenging then others. However, with the influence of teachers who really cared about helping me conquer my battles, I was able to overcome some of these headaches.\\n  Great teachers were a big part of my positive high school experience. They taught in ways that engaged students. They used metacognition techniques to further learning (Donovan, M. S., Bransford J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W., 2000, p.14). The classroom was learner centered and they taught to each students former knowledge and current needs, one really felt like an individual (Donovan, M.S. et al., 2000, p.20-21). In this environment I flourished.\\n  In light of my positive experiences as a high school student, I figured university could only be better. It was not until I showed up to my first lecture, Introduction to Psychology, that my new reality set in. I was surrounded by five hundred students, none of whom I knew, and a scary looking professor with a big white beard sitting at the front of the huge lecture hall. He handed out his syllabus and proceed to go through the readings we had to cover and the assignments and due dates we needed to note. By the end of the week I was completely overwhelmed with all the work I had to accomplish in one semester.\\n  After attending classes for a month, I was very aware that university was nothing like high school. My professors did not know my name, they did not care what my initial understandings and knowledge were about particular topics, and they did not tailor anything to my learning styles. If I was going to succeed in this environment, I needed to adapt the way I learnt to suit the way the professors taught. It was difficult and took some adjusting, but with hard work and determination I got there.\\nReflecting on my experiences leaves me frustrated. University learning is not set up for success for many students. Many professors do not take into account a students’ preconceptions and initial understanding of a topic. If a teacher pays no attention to a students’ preliminary knowledge, the student may struggle with understanding new concepts because the basics are misunderstood or unknown (Donovan, M.S. et al., 2000, p. 10). Furthermore, students in university have to develop their own competence in inquiry. This requires a deep understanding of foundational knowledge and organizing that information in a way that is easy to understand and access (Donovan, M.S. et al., 2000, p.12). Without guidance this is difficult to achieve.\\n  I looked at my shift in thinking from a constructivist view. I changed my pre-existing ways of learning and learnt to adapt to how my professors were teaching (Seifert, 2011, Chapter 2).\\n  I believe it was my hard work and determination to do well that supported my shift in thinking. This transition was very difficult for me, but helped me to develop great skills that are useful today.\\n  References\\nDonovan, M. S., Bransford, J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W. (Eds.). (2000).

For two years prior, I had been in and out of depression and developing anxiety.  In fourth year, I was having daily panic attacks and I felt completely out of control.  I stopped sleeping, socializing, eating, going to work and essentially I just cried.  Finally, I decided to seek professional help, which was the best decision I ever made. \\n              I learned more about myself in therapy than I did during years of school, and I realized that my anxiety and depression had been affecting me behaviorally, cognitively, emotionally and socially for years. \\n              How People Learn explains that “students come to the classroom with preconceptions about how the world works” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000, 10).   I came to my first session with many of my own ideas, but soon after I saw my pre-existing beliefs start to unravel. I started to see how my thoughts, feelings and anxieties were deeply rooted in past experiences and how reluctant I was to let them go, even when presented with other ideas or reasons. \\n              Donovan et al (2000) explains that effective teaching gives students opportunities to recognize their pre-existing understandings and to build on or challenge their initial thoughts. My counselor couldn’t have challenged me more, which gave me the opportunity to confront head on my understandings of the world and myself and to build a new life and identity. \\n              The second finding in How People Learn states that “students must: (a) have a deep foundation of factual knowledge, (b) understand facts and ideas in the context of a conceptual framework, and (c) organize knowledge in ways that facilitates retrieval and application” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000, 10). My panic attacks and inability to cope for so long exemplifies a time in my life when I didn’t have any grasp of the above noted things.   Simply put, cognitive behavioral therapy offered me all three and showed me a new way of living, feeling, believing and acting.   To explain, I learned in therapy that anxiety results from wrongly perceiving danger in one’s life and that during my panic attacks I no longer knew what was real or factual.  Within a few sessions, I began to understand my depression and anxiety, as well as the facts of my life and the ideas I had created within the framework of my life situations, and I started to build a new foundation for myself.  I gained a deep understanding of my anxiety and I learned how to transfer my new insights and coping mechanism to new stressors in my life in order prevent or control future moments that would have previously been terrifying.  Eventually, I got rid of my panic attacks altogether.\\n              Not surprisingly, my counselor took a strong metacognitive approach to my journey and encouraged me to be extremely reflective during the entire process.  Though I can happily say that I am beyond both my depression and anxiety today, I recognize how deeply it effected my education and my ability to learn. This is something that I will keep in mind as an educator, as many students may experience the same.\\n    References\\nDonovan, M. S., Bransford, J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W. (Eds.). (2000).

As a child and adolescent, I attended two private schools where most students were of European descent with similar religious values. Students were expected to conform to the strict expectations of the school and the community. Students and teachers abandoned their own ‘individuality’ to support the school’s standards. Reflecting back on my childhood, I recall the students being similar in several aspects. The students came from middle to upper class families, rarely travelled, and lived in large suburban homes. As a result, our knowledge of culture was confined to dominant nationalities such as Italian, Polish, and German. I was a naive individual, sheltered from other cultural and religious norms in Canada.  I once believed that white Catholics were the only Canadians. My social experiences did not involve many interactions with other nationalities, cultures or religions. Since my interactions were restricted, I needed to explore the world and seek new and engaging possibilities for learning.\\n                  Many students enter university with a variety of preconceived notions. Like Heather (A Private Universe, 1987) I found it a struggle to acknowledge that a diverse world existed outside my previous fixed idea. Students have a difficult time grasping concepts that go against their prior beliefs. Children from a young age develop theories about the things around them, based on what they see and hear. When faced with learning new concepts or experiences that go against original ideas, it can be both challenging and resilient for students to accept new information that contradicts their thinking (Donovan, Bransford & Pellegrino, 2000). Upon entering university I was faced with the cultural diversity of Toronto, thus causing me to view the world through a broader lens. As an educator, I will be more sensitive to any preconceived notions that students bring to the classroom. Teachers must be able to recognize any fixed ideas that their students have, and be able to predict where they come from. In addition, we must be willing to work with such preconceptions in order to understand students’ prior knowledge and experiences, and to allow for positive change and development.\\n                   At seventeen, I graduated high school and attended The University of Toronto for my undergraduate career. I was not prepared for the culture shock that I encountered. Surprisingly, I came to realize that Toronto was extraordinarily different for a city relatively close to my hometown. I learned that it was acceptable to demonstrate your own individuality, and share your cultures and beliefs with others. I considered myself part of a large “community” where people expressed their ideas, and celebrated their identity. I made friends of varying religious and cultural backgrounds. I embraced a city that offered new experiences, relationships and an opportunity to develop as a person. Toronto is comprised of various nationalities and beliefs; however, I realized that this does not separate us as individuals. Culture and religion are a means of identification yet we are still people that share life, love, laughter, and kindness.\\n                     As outlined in How we Learn (Donovan et. al, 2000), students are encouraged to take control of their own learning by having goals and examining ways of achieving them. My appreciation for culture and language sparked an interest in travel. My enthusiasm for culture encouraged me to learn two new languages: Spanish and Italian. In my second year of undergrad, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Europe and recently, I spent one month on a cultural exchange to South America to broaden my understanding of Latin American history and tradition. Travel was my solution to finding a new perspective of the world. Upon leaving high school and entering university, I was disappointed by my lack of cultural awareness. I started to question my identity in a world that I knew nothing about. In Erikson’s terms, role confusion was the result (Seifert, 2009, 48-50). As addressed in The Learning Process (Seifert, 2009), students learn from their new experiences and relate them back to their prior knowledge. It is argued that students learn primarily by creating their own knowledge through experiences (Seifert, 2009, 28). My experiences challenged my pre-existing view of the world to embrace cultural and religious differences. Through my growing appreciation for others, I travelled to other countries to learn more about myself and the world around me. My ignorance as a child has blossomed into a passion for culture, language, diversity and travel. Although fearful at first, I have come to appreciate our true \"Canadian identity\": a unique identity comprised of multiple cultures, traditions and religions.\\n  References\\n            Donovan, M.

I had maintained a high average throughout high school while competing at a national and international level in the sport of competitive swimming.  I was confident in my study habits and time management skills since I had been able to balance school and athletics for years and had been successful in both.  During my first month in university, I applied the same homework and study strategies that I had been using for years and assumed that I would continue to be successful.  I was swimming as a member of the varsity team and was living a similar lifestyle to the one I had experienced in high school.  Unfortunately, when midterms started and I got my marks back, I realized that something had to change.\\n              I was surprised and disheartened when I received my mark for my first university midterm in chemistry: 46%.  Having thought for years that I excelled in the sciences, I didn’t understand how my mark could be so low.  However, as my other marks started to come in, I realized that chemistry wasn’t the only subject that I was struggling with; I was having a difficulty in all of them.  My average had dropped from an 88% in high school, to a 60% in university and I had no idea why.  I started thinking that maybe university wasn’t for me and I continued to struggle.   By the end of first year, I was on academic probation.\\n              I spent the next year of my university career experimenting with a wide variety of study strategies and by the end of the year I was no longer on academic probation.  My grades continued to improve throughout my university career and I think that this was largely related to the metacognitive skills (Donovan, Bransford & Pellegrino, 1999) that I was developing. Donovan et al. (1999) states that each discipline requires a different type of metacognitive monitoring since the information received in various subjects must be interpreted differently.  I was slowly learning this lesson and I began to interpret the information I was receiving in different ways depending on the course.\\n              After reading Donovan et al (1999) and watching “A Private Universe” (1987), I realized that certain important principles of teaching are often overlooked in a university lecture.  In many of the courses that I took during my undergraduate career, professors started directly into material.  They may have started with a brief introduction of what was going to be covered, but they rarely explored students’ preexisting understanding of the subject matter.  Understanding subject matter involves the building upon preconceived notions of that subject and if a student does not have a strong foundational knowledge, they are likely to have difficulty deepening their understanding (Donovan et al, 1999).  In “A Private Universe” (1987), we saw that even after Heather had been taught the correct information about the phases of the moon, she had difficulty moving away from her previous understanding.  I understand that it is difficult to identify student’s preconceived notions in university due to the sheer size of some of the classes.  As a student, I began to recognize this and was able to better succeed by choosing courses in which I was confident that I had a strong foundational knowledge.   \\n              The article by Donovan et al. (1999) states that the goal of learning is the development of a deep understanding rather than simply surface knowledge.  Many of the courses that I took in university tested in a way that was only representative of one’s ability to memorize and repeat facts and I was unable to demonstrate whether I had an understanding of the subject matter.  Tying this back to the metacognitive skills that I had developed, I believe that they helped me identify what courses would require me to regurgitate surface knowledge and which ones would allow me to demonstrate my understanding.  I was therefore able to improve my grades by adapting the study strategy I was using depending on the course.        \\n  References\\nDonovan, M. S., Bransford, J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W. (Eds.).

I always had popular culture in common with my friends and kept up with the most recent cartoon and video game crazes.  This made me who I was, other than being a good student all throughout middle school.  I was in the “crisis of childhood” stage of my development, and, as Erikson states, industry prevailed in my case (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).  I was very comfortable with the way things were going.  I had friends, was quite popular, was doing well in school, and I was having fun.   I had found my niche among my group of friends who were into the same things I was into.\\n  The school that I was in was JK-12, so when I entered high school, I had already had friends from grade eight.  But, I found that people in my class were starting to develop socially in a new direction as puberty was taking place.  The type of humour, which had been “cutting” it in middle school, was now obsolete.  Jokes were becoming more vulgar or “grown up”, and this made me uncomfourtable.  The old popularities of middle school were now seen as nerdy and out of date, but I still liked all those things.  Slowly, the people around me were “changing”, and this determined who I was friends with.  I was no longer one of the popular kids, but I was still a good student, which I took great pride in because it was the only thing that I could relate to with the others.  It felt like the others were in a completely different world then I was in.  They were now talking about relationships and “who liked who”.  I began to feel more isolated and became a social introvert when it came to “their” topics.  This marked one of the most difficult developmental stages that I had to tackle in my whole life, “the crisis of adolescence: identity and role confusion” (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).\\n  As expected, the cliques formed, and I was quite comfourtable in mine.  In the summer of grade nine though, I would be forced to change my “old ways”.  My parents had signed me up to go on an Italian trip with an exchange school, which operated in the GTA.  I would learn Italian in Italy, so it was a good chance to travel and get an extra credit at the same time.  Unfortunately, I would not be going with any school friends.  I was among the youngest kids there.  Most of the people were either grade elevens or twelves.  I was out of my element, and it showed.  My roommate was one of the only friends I had, and even he was trying to get in with the older crowd.  My studious self was not appealing to people because nobody cared about school when they were in Italy.  Students would make fun of the socially undeveloped kids, and I felt more alone than ever before.\\n  I had to make a conscious decision during that summer.  I had to become like them to appeal to them.  “The result is that who a person wants to be may not be the same as who he or she is in actual fact” (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).  I decided to model their humour, and their ability to laugh at their own misfortunes, it seemed.  This was the first time I had to think about my behaviour and how I needed to change it (behaviourism).  It was not difficult to adopt because I had already been exposed to it for a whole year back in high school.  My efforts were paying off, however.  The extrinsic motivation or positive reinforcement given by people laughing at my jokes and accepting my behaviours had conditioned me (operant conditioning) to keep up my efforts and adopt these social behaviours (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 2). To make a long story short, I, as a result of these social influences brought upon by puberty, started to earn respect amongst the older kids.  I carried this on all throughout high school, and it seemed to work on people.  It became who I was developmentally, even though I had not liked it necessarily from the start (or if I look back on it now).  It was the only way I knew how to be accepted and to get people to laugh. \\n              When I entered university, I began to equilibrate socially as I began to tackle a whole new developmental stage,  “the crisis of adulthood” (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).  However, I will never forget the great struggles I went through in my adolescent years where I had to consciously and metacognitively make behavioural adjustments to my own life.\\n    References\\n-       Seifert, Kelvin (2011).

I had a good memory and could easily recall course content. This changed when I encountered my grade 8 science teacher, Guy Morey. While most of my previous teachers were friendly, outgoing, and sociable, he was colder, unfriendly, and had very high expectations for his students. On his first test I received 8 out of 15. I was absolutely stunned. I went to my father to complain, but my father showed me no sympathy and simply told me that I had to work harder. I did not take my father’s advice and I continued to coast in Morey’s course, thinking that I would do well regardless. I performed very poorly on all of Guy Morey’s tests and assignments. For our major project, he required all of us to pick a science topic and do research on it. This was the first time that I was to do extra research outside of the classroom. I did not work hard nor did I do extensive research. As a result, I ended up failing the project. For the first time, I was truly afraid that I could have failed the course. Although I did pass the course, it was an eye-opener for me. By the time I reached grade 9, my attitudes had changed toward my schooling and my science teacher. While I still did not like him, I came to the realization that I would have to work hard, and take initiative in order to do well in his courses. I had to raise my game and learn to work. This shift in my thinking became important and a fundamental reason for my later academic success.  \\n  One possible explanation for my attitudes toward Guy Morey and my shift in thinking between grade 8 and grade 9 could be based on the theory of Abraham Maslow (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Maslow believed that children go through a variety of needs as they develop from a child to an adolescent (as cited in Seifert, 2011). These needs can be classified into two categories “deficit needs and being needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2). Furthermore, “deficit needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2) must be completed first in order to move on to growing “being needs” (Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2). Unlike my student peers (who were 13), I was 12 years old due to skipping a grade and less mature. I was still at the stage where I needed certain “deficit needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2) filled. In particular, I was in the “love and belonging needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Deficit needs: getting the basic necessities of life, paragraph 2) stage. However, Guy Morey was not the caring, nurturing teacher that I probably required at the time. \\n  A year later in grade 9, I was most likely in a stage of transition and was moving toward having “cognitive needs (a desire for knowledge and understanding)” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Being needs: becoming the best that you can be, paragraph 1). Therefore, I no longer needed a teacher to be warm, kind, and sincere as Maslow theorized (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Instead, I was more interested in working hard for Guy Morey and I wanted to show him that I was not a lousy student (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Most importantly, I wanted to show him that I was interested in what he was teaching and that I had a thirst for knowledge, all of which Maslow believed would occur in a child’s growth (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Since grade 8 Science, I transitioned from a smart yet lazy student into a driven, hard working student and someone who took pride in his accomplishments. \\n  Today Guy Morey is a teacher that I fondly remember. He taught me the importance of hard work and the value of gaining self-knowledge, and I feel he is an important catalyst for becoming the person that I am today. One of his life-long lessons that he taught me wasn’t even in his Science class but when he substituted for health class. He asked the class, “How do you know when something has true value?” When none of us could answer he then responded “When it’s gone”. Never has any answer been more poetic. He no longer teaches at my old high school and I wish that I had the opportunity to tell him what an important influence he was in my life. I hope someday that I will.  \\n    References\\n  Seifert K. (2011). Student Development. In Educational Psychology (Chpater 3).

I thought this was an interesting place to start because research shows that the process of making sense of the world begins at a young age (Bransford, 1999, p.10). What came to mind was an incident that challenged my previous moral and spiritual conceptions. Neither of my parents are deeply religious, however I was raised in a catholic household, was baptized before my first birthday and attended a Catholic Elementary School. For the first five years of my life I attended Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church on Sundays. One Sunday when I was five years old my sister who was seven asked my mom, “why are there only alter boys and not alter girls?” My mother could not come up with an answer for my sister. Shortly after this day we stopped attending the Catholic Church and my mother joined CNWE (Catholic Network for Women’s Equality.) Both my sister and I often attended CNWE meetings with my mother and were introduced to a diverse group of spiritual men and women who believed in the Catholic religion but challenged its contemporary institutions. My mother also brought us to a faith community called RUAH that focused on ecology and spirituality. Ruah accepted all members as leaders regardless of their gender or sexuality. These transitions marked a cognitive, social, emotional and moral sift in how I derived my spiritual beliefs.\\n           Despite still attending a Catholic school with religious classes I took what I was taught at face value and outside of school reverted back to my belief that the church could be challenged. My mother and family obviously had a large impact in this shift but so did my school. I realized, as did my sister, that there were inconsistencies in what we were being taught. I had learned in school and at home that all people, regardless of their gender, sexuality, religion or race were equal but I was receiving different messages from the church. The Church never addressed these contradictions or engaged me in critical thinking leaving it easy for me to keep my new opinions when I left the classroom (Brasford, 1999, p.10). I have learned to accept some of the messages of the Catholic Church and disregard others. I am still a spiritual person, but the source of my spirituality is derived from a variety of ideas, people, and locations. \\n           A skepticism of the Catholic Church coupled with life experiences continues to shape my perspective. My father left home when I was a young girl. Growing up I assumed, like many do, that I would get married and “live happily ever after.” Now I wonder if marriage is realistic. Although I know that marriage is present in most cultures and in most religions, I also know that if I still had the conception of the Church as the ultimate authority I probably would not question the value of marriage. At a young age I experienced a moral, social and cognitive shift when I learned that I was able to challenge the Church. This shift continues to have an impact on me today; for example, I am comfortable disagreeing not just with the Church but also with other powerful institutions.\\n    Bransford, John D. Donovan, Susan M. Pellegrino, James W. (1999)          How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice.Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press.,\\n8,121,6,       Over the course of my twenty-three year life, I have spent approximately 23, 040 hours in a classroom.  Consequently, much of my cognitive, social, emotional, and moral development has taken place within a school setting.  Although I can recall many times when I experienced a shift in my own development in each of these respective areas, this brief reflection draws upon a time from when I was 10 years old.\\n         My father’s family is of Armenian descent.  When my dad’s family immigrated to Canada in 1962, my grandfather was especially concerned that his children would lose their Armenian culture and language.  Although it was a great sacrifice for my grandparents at the time, they decided to fund an Armenian school and community center, which today remains a vital part of the Toronto Armenian community.   When it came time for my parents to decide what school I should attend as a student entering Kindergarten, it was only natural for my parents to send me to the Armenian school, where I remained a student until the end of grade four.  When I attended the Armenian school, many years ago, the teachers used very conventional teaching methods.  Our classrooms often reflected monotonous scenes, similar to those one might find in Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off.  Whether it was a direct consequence of these teaching methods, or the lack of extracurricular activities offered at the school, my parents and I decided to look at different schools.  When I was accepted to the Bishop Strachan School (BSS) for grade five, I knew immediately I wanted to become a student there.\\n         The classrooms at BSS resembled very little of what I was used to from my time at the Armenian school where there was no implementation of metacognition, I was simply not thinking and not encouraged to think about what I was learning.  On the other hand,   my teachers at BSS were constantly interacting with students on a level I was unfamiliar with.  Activities in the classroom were very collaborative and hands-on.  Students were encouraged to play a more active role in their learning process. Consequently, I was forced to undergo certain developmental shifts, namely cognitive and social, to keep up with my new peer group.  Even though I was socially interacting with a group of students I was completely unfamiliar with for the first time in as long as I could remember, I still found the cognitive shift to be the more challenging of the two.\\n         Not having taken a Psych course before, I have never formally examined the process of my own learning and development.  However, reading Donovan, Bransford and Pellegrino’s How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice, allowed me to draw on specifically what it was about BSS teaching and learning that was so different from what I had experienced at the Armenian school.  This text highlights an overview of research “on learners and learning and on teachers and teaching” (Donovan et al., 2000).  One of the outcomes of the research presented suggests that a “metacognitive approach to instruction can help students learn to take control of their own learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them” (Donovan et al., 2000).  This is precisely what learning looked like in a BSS classroom.  For the first time, I was taught metacognitive strategies, “including the ability to predict outcomes, explain to oneself in order to improve understanding, note failures to comprehend, activate background knowledge, plan ahead, and apportion time and memory” (Donovan et al, 2000).  Initially, I had a very difficult time keeping up with my classmates.  I struggled with the idea that we did not come to school to rely solely on the teacher for our “learning”.  As metacognition became an integral part of classroom teaching and learning I grew more comfortable with the idea that I was responsible for my own learning.  The idea that I was capable of presenting my own understanding of an antagonist in a book or suggesting a hypothesis for a science experiment for instance, instead of the hypothesis being stated for me by the teacher, was initially very unnatural.  This cognitive shift did not happen quickly.  It was perhaps not until I reached middle school that I began to feel comfortable with the idea of reciprocal teaching and less traditional forms of learning and teaching in the classroom, most of which fell under a metacognitive umbrella. \\n         In hindsight I feel very fortunate to have received the education at BSS that I did.  Although learning is a continuous process, I feel my education at BSS is what truly allowed for me to flourish while at university.  Acquiring metacognitive knowledge greatly contributed to my success at the undergraduate level.  Being aware, both, of my thinking and variables that affect my thinking are invaluable skills that I hope to bring to the classroom as I shift from student to teacher.\\n      References\\n  Donovan, M.

Note the qualifier – this did not apply to friends and family.  But when I interacted with strangers, smiling was a reaction, not the default.  I liked to be quiet and observe; I did not like to talk.\\n  This was a result of both personality and upbringing.  I was an only child and comfortable in my own skin, but often unsure how to interact with others.  For many years I was reserved and introverted; I made few friends and fewer acquaintances.  This state remained throughout high school and much of university.  Despite frequent changes in surroundings and environments, it never occurred to me to change my approach in socializing.\\n  However, in my third year of university I studied for one year in Nantes, France, and my outlook changed dramatically.  I was frightened to be 10,000 kilometres away from home, and apprehensive about living in a country whose customs, mores, traditions, and language were different from my own.  But the observer’s role I had thus far embraced would not have sufficed – I badly wanted to perfect my French, and I could not do so by remaining an observer.  In other words, I could not learn if I was not prepared to do so, mentally and psychologically. \\n  I initially found it difficult to break through the language barrier and years of friendship already forged in French school systems.  Ironically however, it was this very reserve that gave me my breakthrough.  My experience was that the Nantais were friendlier than the dreaded Parisians, but still they were vaguely xenophobic.  If I asked for directions in my passable French, I was helped grudgingly, morosely, and with a vaguely judgmental air.  Yet if I smiled widely before asking their aid – as if to acknowledge implicitly my inherent ignorance, but I beg them humbly to bear with this poor lost foreigner – then they would smile back, or might compliment me on my fine French accent (for a North American), and proceed to direct me along my way.\\n  In other words, I had become a classic example of the Skinner model of operant conditioning (Seifert, 2011, pp.23-24).  Smiling was the operant, and as soon as I get the help I needed, it reinforced my behaviour.  Put in social terms and viewed retrospectively, it seems like common sense – people cannot read each other’s minds, and a smile coupled with a “Thank you” is more powerful than words alone.\\n  Later, I carried my experiences forward during my time in New Zealand, where the sheer openness and friendliness of the New Zealanders reinforced what the French had begun.  It became natural for me to smile rather than to remain staid and expressionless, and by extension I have become more actively engaged in communicating with people.  The change became more or less permanent – and that, I believe, is what Seifert would call true learning (Seifert, 2011, p. 15).\\nSources\\nSeifert, K. (2011, April 22).

My father is from India, and my mother is 5th generation Canadian, her background being Scottish.  To me, my family would have been considered the ‘norm.’  I never thought any differently of my family compared to another and assumed that all students would have either been from, associated with, or aware of multi – racial and/or cultural families.  However, this entire preconception was challenged early on in my life.  I was in Grade 4 and it was the beginning of the school year.  I was standing at the back of the baseball diamond, located on the field beside the student pick– up parking lot.  It was nearing the end of the day and I was waiting for my parents.  When they arrived, they both got out of the car and walked towards the field in order to sign me out.  As they approached the field, another student stopped, starred at my parents and then turned to me.  He asked if my parents were married, and I replied by telling him yes.  He then stated that my parents should not be married because they did not look the same.  My immediate reaction was to get emotional and become extremely confused.  I remember walking away, getting in the car and feeling as if my entire family, its structure, and who I was, was being questioned and “not right.” \\n            This incident created a huge shift in my development, cognitively, socially, and emotionally.  According to one of the three insights on learning in the article How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice, Donovan, Bransford, and Pellegrino (1999) stated “Students come to the classroom with preconceptions about how the world works.”  This notion applies to my shift, because my understanding that everyone came from the same type of family or at least was aware of my family dynamic changed drastically.  I became conscious of other students possible preconceptions as well as my own.  I realized that I should be aware of how each student did not come from the same place that I did.  It is here that my shift directly relates to one of the ideas in How People Learn.  Donovan et al (1999) stated that if student’s initial preconceptions are not engaged, then they may not grasp new concepts and ideas that are taught.  Although this incident was not an academic learning process, I became aware of how my preconceived notions were challenged.  Thus resulting in a cognitive shift in my development, where my idea and understanding of families changed.\\n            In discussing the incident with my parents they informed me that maybe that particular student was not exposed to multi – racial families.  They said that I was not to be mad at him, or immediately put on the defensive if this situation were ever to arise again, because people are and aren’t exposed to the same things. We are all different, and everyone should be accepted for his or her individuality.  This then drove my emotional shift, which has changed me as a person.  I became less sensitive to questions related to my family, and built a stronger sense of confidence.  I learned not to become upset but to gain a deeper understanding of students and tell them about different families, this made me feel like a teacher myself.  This emotional shift in my development led into my social shift.  I became more secure and confident.  I discovered who I was and where I came from.  Furthermore, besides becoming more open minded and aware of each student’s differences, I became more conscious of what it was that I would say to others, so as to not offend or upset them, as I was.  Overall, this incident affected many areas of my development.  It has helped to shape who I am, how I deal with certain situations, and how I understand and recognize the differences of each and every individual student.  Conclusively this was one of the greatest and deepest shifts in my personal development. \\n    Donovan, M. S., Bransford, J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W. (Eds.). (2000).

For the first half of my life, I was an introvert and very quiet. Even as a baby my mom says I barely cried (sorry Kim, I don’t know how to cite my mother under the APA guidelines). I experienced a big change in my personality and social life from grade eight to grade ten. It happened primarily because of, from what I can tell, biological and social influences.\\n  In middle school, I was a weird kid. I didn’t have a good sense of humour and I wasn’t able to laugh at myself. I was pretty socially awkward. I had some friends at school and church, but I had no deep connections with them. In the summer after grade eight, I went on a church camping trip. I learned one of the girls had a crush on me. I was approached by her friends and asked if I liked her too. I didn’t know what to say and I was very confused so I said yes. I was dragged out (literally) to the beach by my friends and she was there with her friends. Unfortunately, I became stricken with anxiety and nervousness. I didn’t know what to do so I ran away from the beach. I ran as fast as I could into the forest. My friends chased after me and dragged me back. I then asked her out, like my friends and I had rehearsed earlier and, shockingly, she agreed. Needless to say, the relationship was short lived (about two weeks if I remember correctly). It seems trivial but I believe it marked the beginning of my developmental moratorium (Sadowski, 2003, p. 11).\\n  When I entered grade nine, I met some very important and influential people. They were incredibly outgoing and I admired their personalities. They had great senses of humour and were always able to laugh at themselves. The new teachers I was surrounded with were extremely kind and caring. They taught me a lot about life and prepared me for the future. They were great role models for me. Because of my new social environment, I felt that I developed a lot. I grew into someone who was not socially awkward anymore. I was able to laugh at myself and make jokes that made others laugh. I became much more outgoing too.\\n  I can imagine operant conditioning (as cited in Seifert, 2011) had a lot to do with this process. Through my initial attempts at humour, I would have used my friends’ responses as feedback to guide my own behaviour. In other words, if I told a joke and they laughed, I would continue to tell similar jokes. Through this conditioning, my sense of humour developed. If I were to look at my development from a constructivist perspective (as cited in Seifert, 2011), then I can see that there was a lot of social constructivism happening. I would take indirect cues from them in social situations. For example, if they were being extraverted, I would feel an invitation to be extraverted also. If the experience was positive, I would assimilate this information and thereafter would understand when and where a certain amount of extraversion is acceptable.\\n  From a biological perspective, my brain continued to develop throughout these years. My cognitive skills, in general, became better, faster and more efficient. I was beginning to be able to process and analyse social situations in better ways I wasn’t able to before. Actually, the development of this nature has continued well past grade ten. I can’t even assume this process has finished. I know that the brain, more specifically the prefrontal cortex, doesn’t completely finish developing until about your mid-20s. I know this part of the brain controls executive functions like planning and decision making, but I believe these functions can be very important in social situations too.\\n  By the time I was in grade ten, I was a very different person from a few years earlier. My development into such a different person was relatively quick. By no means does this mean I finished my social development though. I continued to tweak my personality (sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously) throughout high school and my university undergrad. Tweaking still happens today, although much less frequently than in high school. I also run away from girls much less frequently these days.\\n  Bibliography\\nSadowski, Michael (2003). Adolescents at School: Perspectives on Youth, Identity, and Education. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Educational Pub Group.\\n  Seifer, Kelvin (2011). Educational Psychology. Houston, Texas: Connexions. ,\\n8,126,1,Teaching and learning are most often associated with school and particularly the classroom setting (Seifert 2008).  Although, throughout our academic careers we experience growth, I believe that important shifts in development, whether it be cognitive, moral, social or emotional occur over time and usually when and where we least expect it.  Development in general is a lifelong process and its implications are not always evident until much later in our lives.\\n  This was certainly the case with my development upon entering my first year of university. I enrolled in the Bachelor of Science Program at the University of Toronto in the area of Life Sciences. Coming from high school, where I excelled as a student, I thought that my academic success would continue in University. This idea was quickly confuted after the first round of midterms and definitely after completing my first year where my grades were far from great. This drastic reversal led me to seek advice from family, counsellors, as well as from past and present teachers. After much discussion and research it was clear to me that it was my anxiety surrounding tests and exams that interfered with my ability to achieve the grades that I wanted and deserved. Upon realizing this I thought that my problems were finally over and that I would return to achieving great marks; this however was not the case.\\n  I was unable to deal with my anxiety because I was unwilling to admit that it was a problem for me.  It was hard for me to admit that I, a twenty year old could have a mental health issue that was severe enough to inhibit my ability to focus, retain knowledge and perform on tests. Often misconceptions and preconceived notions affect one’s ability to grasp new information (Donovan et al., 2000). This was true for me as my ideas surrounding anxiety prevented me from coming to terms with my own feelings and, from understanding and accepting the information provided to me by my doctor. Everything began to change for me once I accepted my situation and the fact that I needed to seek help in order to overcome this obstacle. Upon seeking treatment I witnessed great improvement in my marks which in turn increased my motivation and determination as a student.\\n  I believe that this “metacognitive” approach to thinking about my learning (Donovanet al., 2000) truly saved my academic career. I was able to take a step back and reflect on what may be the reason for my poor marks. I feel I grew as a person that year because I realized that one’s cognitive development is not just a result of how much one studies or learns in a classroom but that it can be affected by various factors including one’s own health. I learned that it is important to take care of myself and put “mind over matter”. This developmental shift has influenced the way I look at life and the way I approach situations. Prior to this experience I often pulled all-nighters, pushed myself to the limit and overthought many assignments/tests. I now approach learning with a calmer demeanour and this has helped me to achieve my academic goals more than I thought was possible.\\n  References\\n  Donovan, M. S., Bransford, J.

It’s not your mother or your father keeping you here, it’s you and your wants and desires.  It’s you who you need to cherish and worry about losing, not your family, your friends.  Your family will always be your family, and friendship can be a flexible thing.  You can choose to lead a life, or you can choose to end it.” - Crisis Counsellor, October 2002.\\n  The issue of who has control over one’s life is an important one for a teen.  Often times youth are bombarded with images from society on how their life should be, pressures and assumptions from parents and sometimes educators on the standards they should be living up to, and often times what their goals for themselves are.  Life becomes a very complicated mixture of ideas, thoughts and beliefs, of what life should be, Piaget would call these individual thoughts and ideas schema, and in the case of the larger concept/expectation of life, schemata, the combination of my thinking and my interpretation of others beliefs about my life would be called my cognitive equilibrium (Seifert).   Well, sometimes things shift, my cognitive equilibrium began to get weighed down, those thoughts and beliefs became too much for me to handle, and my own preconceived and developing notions of how I wanted my life to be, began to fade away, leaving me with others ideas, notions and expectations piling up.  That was when things became complicated.  The tables began to turn, and things began to get twisted.  It became a very dark time for my life.  Still though, even through treatment for my problem, I would leave happy, joyous and excited to take on the world, my equilibrium adjusted in a more positive light, but within a few days it would sink down again.  My personal thoughts weren’t able to keep up with the barrage of others ideas and beliefs.  It really became unbearable.\\n  My significant change in thought came from someone who taught me how to prioritize those thoughts, to isolate which ones were mine, and to look deeper at those collections of beliefs.  Suddenly my schemata were back in my control.  I didn’t have to have a perfect grade, that’s not what it meant to be a student, being a student meant learning.  I didn’t need to ‘protect’ my mother, she was a grown woman, and she could do that herself.  I could challenge those notions, I could, in a sense teach myself to edit my beliefs and what does become imprinted on my memory.  Just as I learned to be stressed and perfectionist over school-work, I could learn to let go when it became detrimental to my health.  There were many other lessons I needed, and still need to relearn and revisit to restore my cognitive equilibrium, but I least now I am a little more confident as an educator.  I still have a lot of things to teach myself.,\\n8,128,1,Partway through my undergraduate degree, I got the sense that the act of listening was a good deal more complicated than I had previously thought. I will focus on listening, but the shift I experienced in listening was part of a general broadening of awareness. I began to realize that my perspective was mine only, and that others necessarily saw the world differently, and wanted different things. It sounds like a very obvious thing to know, but I cannot exaggerate how significantly understanding this began to change the way I related to the world around me.  \\n  At around the age of twenty, I began to notice patterns that had been many years in the making. Though appearing in different realms of my life, they shared distinct qualities. In school, for example, I would be returned assignments for which I had received very poor grades, despite having submitted what I thought to be excellent work. Like Heather in the video we watched, I believe I could not see beyond my own initial point of understanding in order to answer the question being asked me, or to understand what was being taught (A Private Universe, 1987). The resulting feelings were indignation and anger, and instead of focusing on a grader’s justification and feedback, I chalked it up to some wrongness in my assessor, or in ‘the system’. Similarly, people with whom I was close would, in my opinion, be at fault whenever there was conflict between us. Sometimes, those relationships deteriorated seriously, and I would walk away from them feeling angry and hurt, but confident in the knowledge that I was not at fault.\\n  Growing up, argument was my family’s default mode of discourse and ‘being right’ its most coveted prize.  Arguing was not about understanding or compromise. The aim was to be heard, and to do so you had to be loud, interrupt and shame and punish those who did not agree with you. Tuning out those who were louder and more violent became necessary to maintaining sanity. This is probably at least partly how I learned not to listen. My learning to tune out may be seen through a Skinnerian lens, the behaviour being reinforced by the pleasure of escape (Seifert, 2011, pp.23-24).\\n  In univeristy, I began to notice that I was not listening, and also that I was becoming inappropriately angry and aggressive when I had arguments with my friends, loved ones and classmates. A conversation with a friend planted the seed of change in my mind. As she spoke about the challenge of listening to really hear and understand, before making judgments, forming counter arguments or tuning out, I nodded gamely, as though I already had already known what she was saying. But her words stuck with me, and I slowly became aware that, especially when agitated, I would fail to listen. Eventually I developed what I think could be described as a conscious strategy of meta-cognitive monitoring to become aware of when I am not really listening (Donovan et al., 2000). Once aware, I could refocus myself and try to let go of my own thoughts. I have practiced this for the past few years, and it has been helpful. Slowly, I am learning how to listen.\\n  References\\n  Donovan, M. S., Bransford, J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W. (Eds.). (2000). Key Findings.

The baseball season is a fall sport therefore tryouts occur in August before classes begin. I was a young 17 year old student athlete fresh out of high school trying to make the team with players ranging in age from seventeen-thirty. I remember feeling anxious, I was unaware of the format of the league, I didn’t know how I would be able to manage school work with baseball, and how I would fit in with the veteran team culture. Currently I am entering my sixth season on the team, over the past six years I have developed in all aspects of the game both on and off the field. Throughout my time on the team, I have and will continue to develop both socially and emotionally, learning about myself and the dynamics of the team.\\n  Last season I was appointed team captain, and with this title came more responsibilities. Comparing it to my rookie season, socially it was much different. I had to lead by example in order to help establish team concepts and guide the younger players. I am still able to joke around and have fun with the team, yet I feel as if I am under a microscope. Some of the younger players do look up to the veteran leaders for information, leadership, reinforcement and guidance. I have developed emotionally over the past six seasons. Baseball is a sport like no other, with time to make decisions before every pitch some believe it is the ultimate chess-match in sport. Early in my career, I have let my emotions get the best of me. I was tossed out of games by the umpire, and have thrown equipment out of frustration. I am an emotional player, but I have learned how to manage my emotions. There have been times this year where I have been frustrated, however I believe that I am more mentally tough. I am more aware of my role on the team and the effect that my actions may have on my teammates. Baseball is a game that is played with your hands and feet, but it is won with your head and your heart.\\n  My development over the years as a student athlete can be looked at through a number of different psychological theories including operant conditioning. For example arguing with an umpire (the operant) results in getting kicked out of the current game and missing the next game (the reinforcement) (Skinner, B.F. 1988). Now I am essentially missing two games where I am unable help contribute to the team. Over the last six years I have matured from a young 17 year old student-athlete into who I am today. I will continue to learn and develop helping to educate and lead from my past experiences gained at the University of Toronto.\\n  Reference\\n  Skinner, B.F. (1988). The selection of behavior: The operant behaviorism of B.F.\\n      Skinner. New York: Cambridge University Press.,\\n8,130,1,  Throughout school, I was all too aware of my difficulty expressing myself. I was astute enough to recognize that something was missing, I just couldn’t figure out what. I approached my teachers, my family doctor, and my parents; they claimed my concerns were “all in my head”, that I was socially acceptable enough, academically able enough, and clearly happy enough - for a teenager. They believed my frustrations were mere teenage angst, and, like some mild cold, would pass. I still remember their voices: “You’re fine. You’re just being a perfectionist. Some people just aren’t good at everything”. It is hard to believe in yourself, when everyone tells you (with apparent affection) that you’re only capable of so much. \\n  After a few long years of struggling and a failed university paper that shook me enough to find a doctor in Toronto for an assessment,  I was diagnosed with a learning disability (Educational Psychology, 2009, p. 125) in my second year at U of T.  This experience caused a monumental shift in my life. Though, I can easily argue that this was a cognitive, social and emotional shift, I would like to focus on my emotional response, for the sake of those who may understand learning disabilities only from the perspective of an educational or learning deficit. \\n  Living with an undiagnosed learning disability is akin to being trapped in the body of a mime. One goes through the actions of learning with varying effectiveness, only able to produce a caricature of expression. By not exemplifying the discrepancy model (LDAO, Learning Disabilities: a new definition, 2001), where a student fails to meet educational standards, no one attributed my personal struggle to a disability. As one of my favorite teachers said, “If you had ADD, you would be bouncing off the walls, and look at you, you’re fine”.  \\n  Many would assume the revelation of being diagnosed would be enlightening - a breath of fresh air - and yet, it only heightened the emotions that were brewing under the surface. In my mind, I had always known that there was something different about me, but being labeled “disabled” affirmed all my worst irrational fears - that I was stupid, a failure, and that wasn’t cut out for academia. Somehow, being told I was fine, was almost better than finding out, I wasn’t. Four years later, I understand intellectually that a learning disability is not the same as an intellectual or developmental disability - but it is still sometimes difficult to shake the conditioned negative response (Seifert, p.19) associated with my abilities as a learner in the classroom setting.  In many ways, my diagnosis created anxiety, where there was none previously. \\n  In sharing this shift in my own emotional experience, I hope that it may help others to understand how complex the emotional experience of a disability is. Moreover, I hope that my experience offers motivation for others to learn more about the experience of students with learning disabilities, so that you may be able to better assist students in any classroom setting.  \\n   ,\\n8,131,4,  A Foray into the Developmental Ramifications of\\nLearning Difficulties on the Teen/Young Adult Students\\n            When I was growing up, I was the type of students that always had his head in the clouds, never did homework (not for a lack of really wanting to), and always forgot about the scheduling of assignments and tests. My teachers and parents told me to really apply myself, “you can do better”, but only if I would apply myself. Fast-forward to second year of university where I was diagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I have never felt stigmatized in regards to my ADHD, nor did I ever feel that it affected my intelligence, but I was seriously annoyed at the amount of time it took me to do school work relative to my classmates.\\n            Following this very late diagnosis, I learned some cognitive methods to help with ADHD and tried some medications. There was a stark contrast between my newfound concentration ability and my old one. I was suddenly able to get over 5-7 pages of material and hour rather than a paragraph per day. After this experience, I noticed that my baseline attention had increased, making life quite easier for me in every day circumstances. By increasing my focus to normal levels, I was able to enhance my memory encoding and retrieval, as well enhance my mental math skills, which require a good working memory for juggling numbers.\\n           One of the major learning techniques we have at our disposal (and are repeatedly encouraged to use it) is metacognition, that is, thinking about the way we think. Following a protocol for managing ADHD increased my level of attention for sustained periods of time, allowing me to better engage in metacognition.\\n            The text gives a good background on the difficulties of having a faulty attention span; “Experts are also able to fluently access relevant knowledge because their understanding of subject matter allows them to quickly identify what is relevant. Hence, their attention [italics mine] is not overtaxed by complex events” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 1999). In my many academic duties, I often found myself unable to deal with complex events because it took so much energy to stay on task that I would often give up. This is interesting because my ability to retrieve data as improved due to an increase in attention (this fits the quoted model above).\\n            My shift was not limited to academics. It also shifted the development of my emotional state, my sociability, my health, etc. I knew I was finally realizing my true potention, I became more confident in myself, and somehow became more extroverted. To me, the change was almost as dramatic as a child leaving the preoperant stage for the operant stage. This goes to show how important one factor in the functioning of the whole brain can negatively impact global functioning if it is lacking. As a result, I will definitely be more aware, and maybe even be on the look out for students that suffer from this oft ignored disability in order to get them the help they need early on and minimize the adverse effects weaken the building blocks on which their future education would rest.\\nWorks Cited\\nDonovan, S.

This was at a party my mother and I attended: a somewhat regular occurrence, as my mother was a single parent who couldn\\'t always afford a babysitter. When we arrived home, she asked me what I thought about various party guests. When she asked about S______, I don\\'t remember exactly how I described him, but in response she told me, “S______ is your father.”\\n  At that point, my entire worldview shifted, causing profound cognitive and emotional upheaval. I was forced to reassess all preconceptions I had about my family\\'s composition. Before meeting my father, I was clearly confused about this, at one point giving my uncle a Father\\'s Day card while he was temporarily living with us. This was an attempt to assimilate (as cited in Seifert, 2011) my uncle\\'s presence in my life with my understanding of what a father was. I worked with the evidence available—he was an adult male who lived with me and my mother—and came to an incorrect conclusion.\\n  It is difficult for me to gauge the effects of this delayed exposure to my own father. Over the last two decades, he and I have worked hard to create a relationship that reflects and fosters our connection to one another; however, I feel on a basic level that I still have not accommodated (as cited in Seifert, 2011) for his presence in my life. He is the one who feels like an uncle to me, because he wasn\\'t present during the formative stages of my life. When I was learning to “approach toddlerhood with a basic sense of trust in [my] caretakers” (Erikson, 1968, as cited in Nakkula, 2008), he was not one of them. In any situation where a father\\'s guidance might be welcome, I have instead an individual whom I know to be biologically related to me, but whose potential influence on my life is minimized by his absence early on. This is not to say that I don\\'t accept or respect him as my father, but simply that our relationship doesn\\'t make perfect sense to me. It is a cognitive itch that I will never stop scratching. Who is this person in relation to me? What vested interest does he have in my success? Should I follow his advice? Why?\\n  In critically examining the fundamental nature of fathers, I take on an outsider\\'s perspective. I am still, emotionally and cognitively, a fatherless child. I am still navigating my emotions and thoughts as they relate to my family dynamic. I am still questioning the very concept of family. For these reasons and more, I cannot say this shift has come to an end. I have been engaged in a struggle for cohesion for the majority of my life, and it continues to this day. I remain hopeful that I will develop some deeper understanding of my father, because I truly love him—I just find it difficult to relate.\\n    References\\nSeifert, Kelvin (2011).

Thank you,\\n  Laura,\\n8,134,2,  I have rarely felt more shame than the Christmas morning, 2009, Kigali, Rwanda, when my friend stumbled upon my backpack and its contents.  Her accusatory stare spoke as only someone else who has had their bag torn asunder at the border in search of this counter-band could; faced with that look, I stumbled through my explanation of the contents.\\n  Yet no explanation could deny what was sitting there for all the world to see,  cocooning my week’s worth of supplies:\\n  That white plastic bag.\\n  Plastic bags are illegal in Rwanda. You can’t buy them in country and there are rigorous checks at the border.  I still blush when I recall the situation.  For the first time in my memory, I took advantage of a position of trust.   I had plastic bags lining my clothes to keep them dry.  Being perfectly well aware that diplomatic privilege is limited to the country of accreditation (Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, p.4), I waved my Canadian red passport at the guard at the Burundi-Rwanda border, pled with him on the grounds of my integrity as ‘one government official to another’, and without one single word of untruth I managed to slip that forbidden white substance through.  The feeling of smug satisfaction and my dry underwear followed me all the way to the capital.\\n  As an accredited diplomat at the Canadian embassy in Zimbabwe, I was habituated to being waved through police road blocks and express lines at border crossings.  I had been subject to over a year of classical conditioning in my interactions with officials (Pavlov, as cited in Seifert, 2011, p.19). Suddenly, on vacation, I was out of that context, in a very similar region but no longer privy to the “rights” I had so recently enjoyed.  What had started as a privilege to aid me in my work had become an entitlement which I carried with me through the unconscious process of generalization (Pavlov, as cited in Seifert, 2011, p.22).\\n  The conversation with my friends that morning forced me to consider the learning that I had undergone.  Utilising metacognition  (Seifert, 2011, p.31)  I was able to assess how much transfer, both positive and negative, there had been of that learning on other areas of my life (Pavlov, as cited in Seifert, 2011, p.22). This was a pertinent question as that attitude was fundamentally contradictory to my values as well as every experience with authority I had ever experienced prior to that past year.\\n  In combating that change, for me it was incredibly important to return to Zimbabwe as an individual after my posting ended, unprotected by and from the mechanisms of power.  At the end of my posting I took some training in Canada and then returned, to the promise of a job in a local boarding school, the situation reversed; completely and utterly at the mercy of the government’s immigration system.  Work permit’s fell through, tourist visa ran out, and I decided to leave given a myriad of factors, including the desire for certification.  A certain amount of fatigue after various encounters with border guards, youth militia, and police had also taken their toll.  And so, I left the land of endless summer and went ‘’home” directly into a culture more foreign than that of Africa; into Quebec, with language immersion, incomprehension and frosty temperatures the rule of the day.  Eight months later, more than three years after my original departure, I’m finally re-entering ‘my’ culture, still very much processing what learning has taken place these past years. \\n    Given I am on a leave of absence, I am often asked if I will ever return to the government in a facilitation or educational systems support function. I hesitate, as although I now own a Dry Peak Bagger in which to wrap my things, the thought of returning still conjures the lingering feeling of that oh-so-slippery plastic.\\n  Seifert, K. (2008).

Although we lived in the same house, sadly, Clinton and I rarely interacted. It seemed like we were too different in too many aspects to be able to communicate on the same page. As well, we had too many of our own selfish ambitions in our agenda to make sibling bonding a priority. I was outgoing and easy-going; street smart, and sociable, and always up for adventure or hands-on activity. My school, Upper Canada College, celebrated this persona as a hallmark of a good learner, contributor, and overall global citizen. Students were implicitly conditioned to uphold values of such citizenship through constant peer and faculty support as well as collaborative class assignments. It became apparent to me that the UCC culture operated on a hybrid of respondent and operant conditioning (Seifert, 2011). \"Bleed Blue\" school slogans were coupled with announcements of upcoming sporting tournaments in Monday assemblies. Friday assemblies would celebrate the camaraderie, teamwork, and initative in attaining victories at those sporting tournaments.\\n  On the other hand, Clinton kept to himself, though not necessarily because he was shy; given his extremely disciplined and overly pragmatic nature, he set his own ironclad deadlines for all concrete goals at the expense of a social life. Why attend a Raptors game when he could learn a new language on Rosetta Stone while loading a five minute-long Raptors highlight reel on YouTube? Why join friends for pizza when he could read articles about the Higgs Boson while having a pizza and just chat with them next class? Yes, University of Toronto Schools students were widely stereotyped as nerdy, but this must have been something exceptional!\\n  Over the years, family and friends tended to judge us by our immediate results, as was a hobby for many traditional Chinese parents. Thus, while my short-term achievements were praised and supposedly promised greatness in the near future, Clinton was labeled as the unemotional, near-robotic recluse who lived in our piano room-turned-private study, much like a mad scientist’s underground den. Our family couldn’t penetrate his shell—whenever we asked what he was up to on his computer and electronic keyboard, he would respond, “Just working on a few things. Trust me, I know what I’m doing!”\\n  “What did you learn at school?”\\n“Very interesting things.”\\n“Like?”\\n“Well okay, math was pretty boring, so I just read Alex’s German textbook and taught myself some phrases. It’s okay, the teacher never sees me!”\\n  Months later, Clinton received news that he had won a Toronto-wide German contest and was invited to live with a foster family for a week in Germany this summer, with all expenses paid for. On the same day, he was elected by his classmates to be UTS’s 2011 Graduating Class valedictorian. Other impossible last-minute stunts for an unemotional recluse included winning silver medals at the International Biology Olympiad, composing original orchestral scores for UTS’s musical concerts, competing alongside nationally-ranked fencers at circuits and exhibitions, and now being a regular contributor to three campus newspapers and journals in his current freshman year at Yale University while carrying more than a full course load and maintaining a full scholarship. It turns out he had enjoyed an enriching social life all along as a by-product of his widespread involvement in and out of class, and is now in a happy, healthy relationship. Save the social aspect, I never had any of those achievements, despite growing up in an achievement-oriented school culture. Strangely, we were never aware of Clinton\\'s activities beyond his everyday coursework and fencing practices.\\n  I realized how wrong we all were to doubt his judgment and assume that his resigned behavior at home must have mirrored his behavior at school. From a strictly utilitarian standpoint, there may indeed be net benefits from choosing the Higgs Boson over friends for pizza. But even if I agreed to this notion during my years at UCC, Clinton’s approach was out of the question simply because it didn’t complement the highly social culture that I had been primed with from my critical age to my coming of age. It likely doesn\\'t complement the norm for the average student anywhere. Yet, I had developed the misconception that Clinton’s behavior at home practically antagonized the spirit of a healthy education that UCC promoted (A Private Universe, 1987), and despite understanding its merits, still labeled his behavior as counter-productive. It still hits me today that while I lived life to the fullest, he made his own life. However, showing outstanding results on paper is enough to kick-off a paradigm shift.\\n  Works cited\\n  Seifert, K. (2011, May 6). The learning process: Major theories and models of learning.

I know I\\'m posting late (I\\'m sick and want to feel somewhat productive...), but I know I played a LOT of \\'educational\\' computer games as a kid.\\n  My dad was a computer geek, so I had the opportunity.  I\\'m pretty sure I played Math Blaster, as well Treasure Mountain!, Treasure Mathstorm!, Treasure Cove!, and Troggle Trouble. \\n  I don\\'t think that teachers will be replaced by computer games, and I do think it can be a good teaching strategy, to make math a little bit more relaxing.  I envision a period in the computer lab spent doing a math game, and students working together, or supporting eachother when they don\\'t know the answer.  The teacher can then \\'teach to the problem\\' if a student can\\'t understand something on screen, or is getting frustrated. \\n  Also, a lot of these computer games allow students to keep trying for a certain amount of times, or has a time-limit, tries can be useful in allowing students to work things out, time-limits could be problematic or help with mental math skills.  If we could take the data from a computer game identifying which students did which questions and how many tries it took, or who excelled at what, that would be a really interesting leap into diagnostics.  Especially if you can set it to say, review division after you\\'ve been teaching that unit.  Maybe it\\'s wishful thinking. \\n  As for all the educational games I played? The verdicts out, but I did pick up language skills quickly, and if I know the processes and aren\\'t struggling to remember formulas, I can do basic mental math fairly quickly. \\n  Edit: Treasure Mountain is math and reading comp skills, whoops!

Other than that I think it is pretty much the choice of the teacher as part of planning the unit. I don\\'t think you will necessarily need to teach concepts related to polygons and angles in isolation as there are a lot of interdependencies. \\n   ,\\n8,163,1,I don\\'t think it\\'s even possible for either to be taught individually without at least making reference to the other. If students are taught about angles, I think they will be able to automatically fill in some formal \"gaps\" in their understanding of polygons, and vice versa.\\n  For example, young kids will be able to identify a rectangle when they see one because all the corners are right angles, and there\\'s something inherently \"special\" about right angles that separate the rectangle from other quadrilaterals when you just look at them. Maybe because it\\'s so orderly and predictable and has an air of being the perfect, ideal quadrilateral... They probably won\\'t know that there are 90 degrees in a right angle yet, but I can imagine a kindergarten teacher telling her students that \"a rectangle is a shape with four sides, and all the corners have to look like this\" (*holds arms up perpendicular to each other*), and the students would truly understand perpendicularity. They just won\\'t know the term.,\\n8,164,1,Hi Michael - mind if I ask how any of these related to your project?

When the chalk is angled towards the direction of the stroke, the force exerted by the hand is transmitted through the chalk and causes it to dig into the board. Because the chalk and board are very rough on a microscopic level, they experience a large amount of friction, so the chalk temporarily stops moving until the force exerted by the hand is great enough to overpower the opposing frictional force. At this point, the chalk slips, leaves the board, and leaves behind a single \"dotted\" mark. The continued force of the chalkbearer\\'s hand toward the board (as it continues its stroke) soon sends the chalk back into the board and again experiencing a temporary frictional force. This cycle continues indefinitely.</bullshiz>\\n  We shall try this in Clive\\'s class tomorrow.\\n  P.S.

Oh well.,\\n8,185,1,  Can Cognitive Development Be Accelerated?\\nAlicia, Tanya, Ed, and Lucas\\n  Our group consulted different resources in order to find material on our topic. Each resource shed light on the specific points and counterpoints we discussed. Below is a short summary from each of our resources.\\n  Point 1:Every child deserves a head start; the earlier children learn, the better.\\n  In the winter of 2011, Kevin Costante, Deputy Minister of Education, interviewed Dr. Fraser Mustard, a Medical Doctor, researcher, and founding president of The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(CIAR).  CIAR is an international collection of people’s research in science and technology, early childhood, economic issues, and determinants of health and human development.  As pointed out in the interview, Dr. Fraser Mustard believes that a child’s capacities for learning and behaviour are “actively developed during early childhood, to the extent that the verbal capacities you find by the age of four…are basically the child’s literacy and verbal capacities for life” (Mustard, 2011. p 4).  This notion supports the Ontario government’s decision to implement a full-day kindergarten program, as this program points to the critical importance of helping children develop cognitively in their early years.  This movement supports the notion that every child deserves a head start and that child cognitive development is not only possible but also necessary. \\n  Counterpoint 1:Academic acceleration is harmful to young students because it takes away from the importance of play-based learning.\\n  The intention of the kindergarten program in Ontario is to provide universal access to early education and to allow for students to be socially and developmentally ready to enter grade one. Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (2001) argues, it is important that the kindergarten program is holistic in nature. Schools should not just focus on academics but integrate play into learning.\\n  Play is a very important instigator in the learning process of young children. Play promotes the understanding of colours, shapes, tastes and sounds. Furthermore, play helps progress literacy skills through words, ideas, and developing concepts. Play can help with the social and emotional progress of a child. Through play children learn about sharing, respect, friendship, competition, cooperation and to connect socially (Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, 2001). All of these life skills are necessary in developing a well-rounded child.\\n  Point 2: Children respond to their environments so we should create environments that promote academic acceleration.\\n  Many educational theorists believe that \"every child deserves a head start\" and that children who are pushed academically at a young age are more likely to succeed throughout their school years. Siegfried and Therese Engelmann (1981) state that \"children respond to the environment...we can take the environment a step further and mold it into a purposeful instrument that teaches and that guarantees your child will have a superior mind (p.10).\" This argument is supported in the article, Meeting the Needs of Young Gifted Students, which states that it is difficult to determine the potential that young students possess (Meader, 1996). It is not in a young child\\'s nature to ask for new challenges; as educators, we must ensure that our teaching practices accommodate needs that vary from the norm and challenge children\\'s interests and understandings (Meader, 1996). By observing each student as a unique individual and offering a range of activities, educators can strive to offer challenging experiences and facilitate the optimal development of each child (Meader, 1996).\\n  Counterpoint 2:If you teach a young student something they are not ready to learn, they may memorize the right answer without necessarily understanding the problem.\\n  The public education in Finland is widely known for starting formal schooling at age seven.  Finland has also consistently scored near the top of all the international test rankings in education across the world (Sax, 2007).  While children have been starting academic schooling later, there has been a push in North America for kindergarten to look more like grade one did thirty years ago: focused on reading and writing, and numeracy (Elkind, 1996).\\n  Developmentally, this is impractical. “Young children\\'s rates of intellectual attainment are quite variable, and it makes little sense to have uniform, standardized kindergarten. Even children with similar intellectual potential may be at very different intellectual levels (Elkind, 1996)”. Trying to teach a student something they are not ready to learn may lead them to adapt how to give the “right” answer even though they will not necessarily understand the problem.  Something as simple as holding a child back a couple of years may actually help them get ahead, as they will be able to learn that same concept faster at another stage of their biological and cognitive development.\\n  The reality in a 21st century kindergarten class where academics is highlighted is that the teachers divide children into two groups: with the teacher are the kids who are ready for paper and pencil reading and writing and then the group of kids who the teacher recognized as not ready to learn to read and write.  With such segregation, kids start to determine very young that they are in the “dumb group” and form negative opinions of school very early (Sax, 2007).\\n      References:\\n  Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario.

New York, \\n     NY: Basic Group, Ch 2.\\n     ,\\n8,187,2,An anecdote I thought I\\'d share relating to today\\'s discussion about the pizza party money theft scenario.\\n  When I was in grade 3, I was a bit of a kleptomaniac and rarely tried to restrain myself from pocketing a few classroom items for no real purpose. It started with chalk and pencils, then escalated to a small box of paper clips (I especially liked the vinyl-coated ones) and plastic rulers. I think at one point I pinched a five-pack of floppy disks.\\n  Did I know I was doing wrong? I don\\'t think it hit me that it was categorically wrong to steal; I was more utilitarian about it. My teacher had drawers full of stationery, so what\\'s one piece of chalk more or less for him? He probably wouldn\\'t even notice, whereas for me the chalk would be a trophy, a prized token, an artifact. It would be treated with dignity! Besides, I couldn\\'t buy my own chalk if I wanted to. The net gains certainly outweighed the losses; it was most definitely a just cause!\\n  Taking from my unsuspecting classmates was trickier to justify, for we were all equals and thus my gain was equal in magnitude to another\\'s loss. Hmm...But what\\'s this? Everyone has a Tamagotchi? Everyone has a mechanical pencil? I was so enthralled that an equal could own something that I\\'ve never seen before. These were mysterious items, but at the same time the fact that the transparent Techniclick pencil was just lying there unattended and all alone on the desk next to mine and as real as an HB pencil took away from its mythical quality.\\n  *yoink*\\n  With a mechanical pencil in my backpack, I felt like a super tech-savvy, modern-day wizard. If I can\\'t say \"open sesame\", then at least I could summon lead from a plastic pencil with the press of a button.\\n  The excitement lasted no more than two days.\\n  But how could I return these items to their proper owners? Confessing would be like turning oneself in to police. Dumb idea. Leaving them in the original spots I found them didn\\'t seem quite right either. 1) It\\'d seem a lot more natural if they were lost forever; my classmates will just assume that they carelessly misplaced them, and they\\'ll forget about it sooner or later. But if I placed back the pencils, they\\'d think something fishy was going on and their souls would never rest. 2) If my classmates would ultimately be reunited with their belongings, then surely it wouldn\\'t hurt if I held onto them a bit longer, just to maximize my utility. I mean, if I took the trouble to pocket the pencil in the first place, then I might as well make it worth my while!\\n  Several months later, I lost my pencil case, with the mechanical pencils, paper clips, plastic rules, and chalk in it.\\n  -Cak\\n  P.S.

You da best.,\\n8,195,4,This is the only time in my life I think I\\'ll ever be able to overglorify the teacher in a colourful, psychedelic fart with supernatural streaks of light radiating from my body.\\n  [click to enlarge]\\n  Vision of Good Teaching Mind Map—Artist Statement\\n              Admittedly, I approached the aesthetics of this piece rather haphazardly, being guided only by the traits that I associate with ideal teacherhood. These traits were organized under four umbrella ideas: a teacher should 1) inspire his students to find joy and passion in personal growth, 2) have a solid grasp of the knowledge not only in his designated subject area but also in educational issues, 3) love his students unconditionally as being entrusted by other parents with the well-being and dignity of their children, and 4) maintain professionalism in the best and worst of times. These traits make a teacher well-equipped and well-rounded in all aspects of education and school life, and trickle down into the student’s holistic learning experience.\\n              As my mind map unfolded with more extensive branching into the specifics and nuances, a bittersweet notion became more apparent and somewhat more jarring: teachers have among the most humanitarian and most noble professions in the world, but are also among the least appreciated and least prestigious. I was suddenly instilled with the imperative to glorify the teacher as an individual whose essence of sheer inspiration, knowledge, professionalism, and love, radiated in a loose but controlled manner and spilled into the lives of those he or she reaches. Each of the four core aspects is given a colour and a simple “logo” that (remotely) depicts the spirit of that aspect. The green swish symbolizes the elevated, fanciful nature of inspiration, the yellow wave is an icon of harmony and consistency, the blue two-lobed brain represents knowledge, and the red heart top celebrates the nurturing guardian. These aspects originate from the teacher, who is almost deified as streaks of light seem to spill from his body in a star-like pattern. Lastly, two silhouettes are visible in the background, subtly paralleling the sections of the mind map in front.\\n  -Cak,\\n8,196,1,...I will give you a cookie.\\n  No really, check it out.

As mentioned in the point/counterpoint discussion, some people view the self-esteem movement as having problems, causing negative impact on students. Dr. Dona Matthews explains that self-esteem can be classified under a fixed mindset explanation (Dr. Dona Matthews, Conference, November 22nd, 2011). This means that, “some children are categorized as inherently smart and some are not. The fixed mindset is associated with lower achievement and self esteem” (Dr. Dona Matthews, Conference, November 22nd, 2011). Students who have high self-esteem may be hesitant in accepting constructive criticism, impacting them in further excelling in their academic studies.\\n            Contrary to this belief, the self-esteem movement has shown promise, but it may be more appropriate to change the words “self-esteem” to “self-efficacy”. Promoting self-efficacy may prove more meaningful since he or she would be encouraging students to believe in their abilities. Promoting self-esteem praises the person rather than the capabilities of the student (Seonaid Davis, Personal Communication, November 2011).       \\n            Another aspect of student diversity includes the idea that students have different multiple intelligences (MI). Conventionally, “intelligence” has been thought of as a single broad ability that allows a person to complete different kinds of tasks (Seifert, 2008). With this view, students are either intelligent or unintelligent. Gardner’s Theory of MI presents an alternate view which states that intelligence comes in many forms (Campbell & Campbell, 1999). Teachers and entire schools have implemented Gardner’s Theory of MI, making it the basis of their curriculums (Campbell, 1995). Incorporating MI theory in instruction allows teachers to diversify instruction, thereby responding to student diversity, which in turn increases self-esteem. Therefore, MI theory positively influences teacher beliefs about intelligence, instruction, and student achievement (Campbell, 1995).\\n            The multiple intelligence theory, however, is not as clear as it is presented to us in books. Kristen Nicholson-Nelson (1998) points out that, “in reality, educating young children means recognizing that each of them is unique, complex, and highly individualistic” (4). Children should be seen holistically, and not just categorized into one specific type of intelligence. As she suggests, “their overall intelligence is based on the sum of all of their intelligences” (4). One multiple intelligence cannot be used without the other.\\n            If teachers are not careful, they can begin to categorize students, creating a stigmatism. After some time, students may appear confident in one area of intelligence, but lack self esteem in the other areas. Since most activities in the classroom, and even in the workforce, do not rely solely on one specific type of intelligence, this categorization may become problematic for many students who have been given a label, or a stigmatism.\\n            The idea of gender is another component of student diversity. Many people argue that boys and girls learn the same since several parameters outside of gender explain why students learn differently. Why must gender be the sole explanation for why students perform different academically? According to Eliot (2010), gender is a poor predictor of any individual student performance, and this is why considering other factors such as age, race and ethnicity is suggested. Eliot (2010) discusses how boys’ and girls’ brains are relatively the same. In other words, these few differences cannot be held accountable for gender diversity. It is more accurate to say that ALL students learn differently regardless of gender. Boys or girls are more diverse in their own gender compared to the difference between boys and girls (Eliot, 2010). Identifying students interests based on gender confirms the media’s stereotypical images associated with boys and girls. As a result, single-sex schools confirm these stereotypes and shelter students from real-life scenarios where males and females coincide (Chan, 2011).\\n            On the contrary, some argue that boys and girls learn differently. Other sources state that women’s brains are physically different in comparison to those of men (Eliot, 2010). Evidently, this explains why male and female students have varying interests. Timing of the development of gross motor skills differs towards the end of elementary education (Seifert, 2008). Consequently, teachers may have preconceived notions, which in turn affect the way students perform, their learning, and their self-esteem (Campbell & Campbell, 1999). Girls experience an academic transition during their school years. Female students, though more motivated initially, “may try to down play their own academic ability in order to make themselves more likeable by both sexes” (Seifert, 2008, 63). Ultimately, this supports the notion that single-sex schools are beneficial and important when it comes to student learning and development. For example, TDSB discusses the pros and cons of implementing single-sex schools within the public sector (Chan, 2011).

Will comment more on them...\\n  For now, here\\'s a brilliant music video that I\\'ve probably watched at least 30 times, produced by legendary video artist Michel Gondry. This is among my favourite music videos of all time! The math is more explicit in \"Making of Star Guitar\".\\n    -Cak,\\n8,237,3,One of my hobbies when I had a life was making music, and from time to time I\\'d try to recreate popular songs for fun. I wouldn\\'t use this video as a teaching tool per se, but maybe more as an exposure tool to show students how mathematics is the basis for a lot of musical concepts like structure or phrasing (e.g. 4 beats to a bar, 4 bars to a phrase, how adding certain syncopated sounds creates a certain \"groove\" in a beat or riff, etc.). Students can see how the timing of the notes (unlike on a staff) literally correspond with their spatial position on a sequencer. i.e. If the notes are equally spaced on the screen, you\\'ll hear them at equally spaced time intervals. Furthermore, if you have Audacity, you could show the effects of cutting out sections of music from the original; if you remove, say, 5 or 9 beats, students would get \"thrown off\", whereas if you remove 8 beats, no one would notice.\\n    -Cak,\\n8,238,6,Another Gondry/Chemical Brothers collaboration is \"Let Forever Be\", which you could use to discuss rotational symmetry, congruency, kaleidoscopes, geometry as a method of constructing/understanding visual perspective... or just enjoy a really well-made video:\\n  http://youtu.be/s5FyfQDO5g0\\n  (p.s.

When a behavioural model was increasingly viewed as too limiting to accurately account for the various facets of motivation, various cognitive theories were developed. \\n  “Motivational Behaviour – A GIEDE” can serve as a method to remember the 7 main theories:\\nMotivation As: Behaviour Change; Attribution; Goals; Interest; Self-Efficacy; Self-Determination; and Expectancy-x-Value. \\n  In each of the cognitive models, intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation are important underlying concepts which are either dealt with directly or have important consequences for the motivation being discussed.  Overall, the TARGET model (Task-Authority-Recognition-Grouping-Evaluating-Time) provides for an integration of most of the concepts touched upon by the above models (Seifert, 2011). \\n  Behaviour change looks at how motivation can be influenced by observable behavior.  For example, positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement look at how adding stimuli can trigger behaviour change.  Attributions look at the reasons for why students get motivated.  The reasons include the source of the attribute, whether the attribute is controlled, and how constant the attribute is. Motivation as goals looks at how one’s goals can influence motivation.  Students with a “mastery” goal for knowledge or skills are more likely to remain motivated than students whose interest is focused on performing according to an external standard, whether that is to standard or simply avoiding failing that standard.  Students are also motivated by their level of interest.  Interest can be short or long term, situational or personal.  Motivation as self-efficacy looks at how students will become motivated based on whether they believe that they can accomplish the task.  Motivation as self-determination is focused on choices and whether students have the ability to determine their choices. Lastly, student motivation can be related to whether or not they expect to succeed in completing a task compared to its relative value.  TARGET integrates the above and takes into consideration the task, autonomy of student, recognition, grouping, evaluation, and time, for a holistic view of motivation (Seifert, 2011).\\n  Some teachers believe that adding fun activities to course content can help engage students in learning material.  However, the research in this area is inconclusive, indicating that not only does “fun” not always help, sometimes it can actually hinder learning.\\n  It can be helpful to engage students by adding games, challenges, and tasks into the lesson to promote student involvement.  Students gain a sense of ownership in specific tasks, leading participants to develop an intrinsic motivation to win/participate (Moss, 2000).  Fun activities in the classroom can help students remember difficult concepts, as they can relate the activity to the material.  As Guthrie & Alao (1997) study indicated, students were more likely to read more when they became interested in the material. \\n  Furthermore, when students participate in fun activities, they can work together and use critical thinking in order to solve/navigate a particular task or puzzle (Matthews & Lowe, 2011).  Critical thinking is used to engage students in their learning.  By presenting students with scenarios or specific tasks, not only are these activities fun for students but they will promote students to practice and develop both their critical thinking and problem solving skills (Matthews, & Lowe, 2011).\\n  Conversely, fun activities can be a deterrent toward learning if the fun activity is irrelevant to the learning goal. A topic will remain the same even if fun activities are added to it rather than integrated as part of the material (Dewey, 1913) When fun activities are added to topics to make them more interesting, research has shown that students were less able to remember the learning goals than the control group, despite their significant recall of the extraneous “fun” detail (Harp, & Mayer, 1993).  Furthermore, when required to take those learning goal facts and transfer them into required procedures, the learning that had taken place did not easily transfer (Dillon, Martin, McCaughtry & Shen, 2006).\\n  The issue of whether or not “fun” should be integrated into learning ties most closely to the “interest” model of motivation, and the attempt to move the student from a position of “no” or “low” interest, to “situational” interest, to “personal” interest.  Although can add fun activities to engage student learning and increase motivation, it is important to remember that it is only situational and that it is important to analyze whether the activities are truly logically related to the material being conveyed.\\n      Reference List:\\n  Dewey, J.

A critical thinker is able to ask relevant questions, evaluate evidence for ideas, reason through problems both logically and objectively, as well as express ideas coherently and precisely. These skills are transferable not only to other classrooms but to the real world. After all, the classroom is a microcosm of society. With the confidence to think and the ability to focus on a situation or given context from a variety of angles, students who are critical thinkers contribute to society and feel that their contribution is valid (de Bono, 2012).\\n            Pressley’s Good Strategy User Model mirrors the benefits of critical thinking that CoRT promotes. Pressley believes problem-solving strategies enhance comprehension and help students overcome past comprehension failures (Pressley, 1989). Similarly, the Reciprocal Teaching approach by Palinscar and Brown (1984), advocates for direct teaching of metacognitive skills through comprehension fostering and comprehension monitoring activities. Through activities and practices, such as Reciprocal Teaching and the Good Strategy User model, students become confident in and capable of taking on leadership roles in the classroom.  They also develop their own ideas and thought processes, extract pertinent information from given texts and monitor their own comprehension and progress as a learner.\\n            Students who learn through discovery think for themselves, acquire information independently and gain powerful intellectual skills that will prove to be invaluable in all facets of life (Papert, 1980). \\n            Contrary to the aforementioned benefits of teaching critical thinking and problem-solving in schools, experts are not convinced that those skills transfer to new and varying contexts.  E. D. Hirsch, a well-known critic of thinking programs such as CoRT, feels there is no adequate or substantial proof for the effectiveness of such programs. Rather than fostering skills and strategies for thinking, Hirsch believes that focusing on content is far more valuable than on process. He believes that if students do not have a broad knowledge base their comprehension will not improve and vocabulary gaps will remain problematic for many students, as the gaps in their learning can only be remedied by honing in on content itself (Hirsch, 2006).\\n            Similar to Hirch, Siegler (1993) raises caution that teaching direct metacognitive skills hinders student learning rather than helps it.  Siegler highlights that if students are distracted by the strategy they are supposed to be implementing and solely focused on mastering it (as their teachers may encourage), they may be less focused on the content itself.  As a result, students may not process the necessarily information from the lesson and find little benefit from the lesson.\\n            Chapter 9 in our course textbook articulates and represents the way we personally feel we would approach the issue of critical thinking and problem solving in schools. As the approaches in instructional strategies are numerous, and even more are being developed and introduced, we feel that we gained a tremendous amount from researching this point and counterpoint and from the opportunity to share it with our classmates. We realize that deciding which strategies to employ and when to implement them is in our hands, and we hope to find a truly balanced approach that appropriately suites the needs of our students, the demands of society, and the outlines of curriculum. \\n    Resources: \\n  Almasi, J.

This is part of a Professional Development session that our group is leading later this afternoon on Technology in Classrooms.\\n  This can definitely be used for younger students too.\\n  Grade 10 students should be able to identify cells in various stages of mitosis (division), and also describe what combinations of microscope features (objective lens, diaphragm, coarse adjustment knob) were used to attain certain images.\\n  Hope you enjoy!\\n  EDIT: The game functions better if you play directly on the YouTube page: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miNXrmgFzd4\\n    -Cak,\\n8,277,1,This can be asked for older students as well: Why is this a funny photo?\\n    -Cak,\\n8,278,1,Someone should write to them.,\\n8,279,2,The important thing about math anxiety is that we as teachers can diminish it\\nMath anxiety stems from an emphasis on black and white answers\\nMath anxiety stems from an emphasis on speed\\nMath anxiety stems from an emphasis on students\\' public display of ability\\nMath anxiety stems from a lack of confidance \\nMath anxiety stems from a belief: you are either born able to do math or not\\nMath anxiety stems from a percieved innate inability to do math\\nBut the important thing about math anxiety is that we as teachers can diminish it\\n ,\\n8,280,2,The important thing about motivation is to encourage it\\nYou could provide problems, puzzles, activities,\\nOr you could have them create their own\\nYou could ask questions that make them think\\nas well as provide alternatives, choice, extenstions and differentiation \\nYou coud foster creativity\\nBut, the most important thing about motivation is to encourage it,\\n8,281,1,  The important thing about textbooks is that, get this, there\\'s more\\nTextbooks, they come with teacher resources:\\nAdditionals, hypotheticals and even environmentals but, get this, there\\'s more\\nThey\\'re thoughtfully designed with the curriculum in mind, but, get this, there\\'s more\\nSuch time and consideration \\nGoes into each textbook\\'s edition \\nThat even the chapters should be followed in order but, get this, there\\'s more\\nYou get to read in ways that you don\\'t normally read\\nAnd think in ways that you don\\'t normally think but, get this, there\\'s more\\nThese mathematical manuals are full of information\\nAnd the fact that they relieve is just as amazing\\nBut the important thing about textbooks is that, get this, there\\'s more,\\n8,282,1,The most important thing about practice is that you need to make time for it. \\nIt\\'s not like your grandmother remembers,\\nIt\\'s not just memorization and rules. \\nProblem solving, visualization, communication\\nand metacognition! \\nThese things need practice. \\nThe amount of practice needed will vary \\nThe type of practice should be engaging\\nBut the most important thing about practice is that you need to make time for it. ,\\n8,283,2,The important thing about integers is that there are numbers hiding behind the zero\\nA positive integer is always bigger than a negative integer\\nAnd a bigger negative is always less than a smaller negative\\nGet this, they can all be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided\\nBut you have to follow principles, listen close, I\\'ll provide some\\n2 negatives add to make a bigger negative\\n2 negatives subtract to make a positive, or a smaller negative\\n2 negatives multiply and divide to make a positive\\nConfused?

I thought no one would get it!,\\n8,321,1,,\\n8,322,1,,\\n8,323,1,wow, I never thought of it that way.....to tell the truth, I dont even remember how I was taught.  I just know!  haha,\\n8,324,1,Hm...for me, it was \"start out with +ve x +ve = +ve\" which makes sense on its own, and then whenever you add a negative sign in there, it switches the sign in the product. So if you have an even number of -ve signs, they \"cancel out\", which means if you have an odd number of -ve signs, there will be one -ve left over and make the product -ve too.\\n  Somehow it was really intuitive for me when I learned it that way. It made it seem like every -ve sign in the expression played a role in determining the product\\'s +/- sign.\\n  Like, in -a x -b x -c = d:\\n  the first -ve sign would make the product -ve.\\nBut the second -ve sign would negate the first -ve sign, thus bringing the answer back to +ve.\\nBUT the third -ve sign would make the product -ve again!\\n  So based on this reasoning, a student wouldn\\'t have to worry about how many factors appeared in the expression--it\\'s a one-size-fits-all \"explanation\".\\n  No idea if that made sense, but it\\'s easier to explain saying it out... >_>\\n  -Cak,\\n8,325,1,,\\n8,326,1,But in all seriousness, what I was really thinking about is how much less math anxiety I have now than I did at the beginning of the year - not even specifically from a teaching perspective, in fact more from a student of math perspective. Although I will probably never use a caraction, specifically, in my own teaching, this course in someway or another has furthered my ability to learn math as a student - so (albeit about Limin) I was really trying to figure out what it was about the way this course has been taught that has allowed for this to happen for me.,\\n8,327,1,My Gr. 9 math teacher used to always say:\\n\\nPractice does not make perfect - if you practice math incorrectly over and over, practice won\\'t help you.

It\\'s a really neat investigation (and currently ongoing!) if you get past the icky mental graphics...so I strongly encourage sharing this story in your grade 5 (Properties/Changes in Matter) or 10 (Chemical Reactions) science class this February if you feel your students can stomach it!\\n  Maybe you can even get students debating what tactics (based on scientific reasoning) they would use if they were lawyers defending PepsiCo or representing the unfortunate plaintiff.\\n  The story in a nutshell (originally from http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-mountain-dew-really-dissolve):\\n  Just this mid-January, a man in the U.S. claimed that a can of Mountain Dew he was drinking out of contained a dead mouse (since he was able to pour it out).\\n  How does PepsiCo reject this claim? The man\\'s allegation is impossible, because their drinks are so corrosive that the mouse should have been dissolved by the citric acid before he got a chance to drink it!\\n  I\\'ll just leave the discussion there...\\n  In the meantime, here\\'s one of a currently growing series of amateur videos documenting a home experiment trying to see whether a mouse would actually dissolve in Mountain Dew. I\\'m anticipating a video with the results within a few months...\\n    -Cak,\\n8,331,1,It is very \"teacher-like\" of you Limin :).\\nIn my \"poem\" I refered to passion for teaching.  I don\\'t think you have to be a math expert or know all the latest and greatest techniques, but if you care about students\\' learning you will eventually find a way. In a sense passion about teaching eventually leads to passion about the content area, at least for me. \\n  If I have to teach something, I need to first ask myself \"why am I teaching this? Why should my students care about it?\". If the only answer I can come up with is \"because it is in the curriculum\" then I know it\\'s not going to be a great lesson. We learn in OISE that we need to be able to relate the content to students\\' lives, and I think the first step is to be able to relate the content to ourselves.\\n  So while I will not necessarily be passionate about every subject I teach, I hope to be passionate enough about students\\' learning to make the extra effort and find the motivation to teach what I teach. \\n   ,\\n8,332,1,Yes, we learned backward planning in social studies and in fundamentals of teaching.

Way too many first year U of T life science students taking were nearly failing their chem courses (the average student dropped 20% in their chemistry course average from high school to first year), so we wanted to research the pedagogical and content knowledge gaps there. It entailed interviewing first year students, distributing surveys among TDSB chem teachers, and statistical analyses...a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. One of the points in our results, for example, was that more chem teachers than we expected found themselves running out of time teaching advanced concepts required for first year chem (course structure at high school isn\\'t very conducive to gaining chem knowledge & deep understanding). That was my ROP in a nutshell :),\\n8,340,2,If you\\'re like me, you probably insisted on staying at the giant ball machine for well over an hour at the Science Centre when you were a kid (and had a strange fascination with Rube Goldberg machines).

The argument against brain-based education contends that its implications are not clear, and thus it is not advisable to use such techniques. However, this is a loaded statement and we must evaluate it in multiple steps.\\n  Misapplication\\nOne reason the implications of brain-based education may be unclear is that inappropriate methodologies are currently in use. Alferink and Farmer-Dougan (2010) examine brain-based education across several settings, focusing on special education in particular. They point to left-brain/right-brain based curricula as an example of inappropriate technique, stating that the two hemispheres work simultaneously and thus, \"hemisphere-specific instruction is not a method for improving neocortical processing\" (Alferink & Farmer-Dougan, pg. 44). While this is a legitimate stance against lateralized instruction, it falls flat as an argument against brain-based education on the whole, since we do not intend to base our teaching on flawed or outdated science. \\n  Responding to the research\\nOISE would not have a course on child and adolescent development if the brain were not extremely important in our teaching. As educators, we will be providing the stimuli for thirty brains a day, for several hours at a time. Thus, our task as researchers and educators is to parse the research effectively, choosing and testing the procedures that will yield the most benefits in our practice. We must develop a working understanding of cognitive mechanisms in order to evaluate our options. \\n  To that end, our group has prepared a brief primer on relevant neurological processes, with an eye to the adolescent brain in particular, and a few research-supported techniques for improving memory formation and retention in our students.\\n  Practical information about the brain\\nMemory formation depends on the interconnectedness of brain cells (neurons), which connect to other neurons via their nerve fibres (axons). The more often neurons communicate with each other, the more closely related their patterns of activation are; that is, when one neuron fires, it becomes significantly more likely that the other related neuron will fire. A memory is formed when a network of axons becomes strengthened in this manner. This is known as long term potentiation (LTP). It is essential to understand LTP because it is how learning takes place. It is also the means by which short-term memories are encoded into long-term memory.\\n  As educators, our primary objective is to have students create new networks of memories, or link different memories together; as such, it is beneficial to know how the brain works.\\n  Also crucial to memory is a component of the brain called the hippocampus. The axons in this area of the brain have a important job, which can be likened to indexing memories. Neurons send signals to the hippocampus to locate a repertoire of information elsewhere in the brain. The more LTP occurs, the easier it is to access that information via the hippocampus, and solidify that connection. This is the biological basis of learning.\\n  Links to adolescence\\nThe adolescent brain is undergoing a complex variety of transformations, making their actions, emotions, and decisions difficult to comprehend. Traditional studies justify the uncertainties of the teenage brain with the notion that the brain is no longer in a critical period of development. This means that learning and decision-making becomes more difficult with age. This theory has been challenged with the concept of plasticity, which refers to the power of the brain to change as a result of input from the environment. The human brain has been proven to remain plastic well into stages of adulthood (Understanding the Brain, 2007).\\n  During adolescence, individuals are able to create more intricate thoughts, however, they may suffer from poor decision-making due to limited emotional development. Neuroscientists compare the teenage brain to a sports car as the brain has “high horsepower” with “poor steering” (Understanding the Brain, 2007). A teenage brain generally has an underdeveloped pre-frontal cortex. This area of the brain is associated with behaviours, expression and decision-making. Additionally, adolescents tend to have an immature cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for muscle coordination and the process of thinking (PBS). As teenagers are generally targeted for being rebellious, troublesome, and at times apathetic; these studies have proved that these labels are due to stages of brain development. \\n  Selected classroom techniques (C-H-A-R-M)\\nChunking with graphic organizers: As the human brain can only hold 7± 2 discrete pieces of information (Miller, 1956, cited in Wolfe, 2001), our job as educators relies on our ability to \\'chunk,\\' or sort, information into manageable, meaningful chunks. One way of doing this is to provide graphic organizers for students, to make sense of the information we introduce.  \\n  Healthy amounts of stress: Students who experience high amounts of stress will experience disruptions in brain cell development (Willis, 2006). It is incumbent on us to create a low-stress environment for our students, and to that end, Willis suggests the following: support and understand teens through their mood swings, give them opportunities to be honoured for their individuality, build confidence by building community and connectedness. On the other hand, manageable stress can be beneficial to memory, which biologically supports the practice of Minds-On activities involving surprise, humour, etc. \\n  Association: Information without context is forgotten rapidly (Ebbinghaus, as cited in Wolfe, 2001). By connecting new concepts to familiar experiences, the corresponding neuronal connections increase in strength and complexity, and this process is directly implicated in memory retention.\\n  Rehearsal: In some contexts, so-called \"skill and drill\" techniques are appropriate. Wolfe (2001) refers to Bloom\\'s notion of \"automaticity\" (pg. 102) as a state reached only after repeated rote rehearsal. Performance in areas such as the arts, sport, mathematics or carpentry, improves with automaticity: in these areas, students might benefit from more traditional teaching techniques.\\n  Multimodality: Alferink and Farmer-Dougan encourage incorporating a broad range of instructional techniques into our repertoires, even in the case of a known ability or preference within one learning style, saying \"[t]he larger the child\\'s inventory of learning strategies, the more likely the child is to learn across environmental settings\" (Alferink and Farmer-Dougan, 2010). Perhaps it goes without saying that a diversity of tactics would yield robust learning experiences, but it is comforting to know that the research supports our intuition in this matter. \\n  *\\n  Alferink, L.A., and Farmer-Dougan, V.

Parents\\nPoint\\n- parents favour homework (National PTA, Gill & Schlossman, 2004)\\n- benefits of parental involvement (National PTA, Van Voorhis, 2011)\\nCounterpoint\\n- parental involvement can turn to parental interference (Cooper & Valentine, 2004)\\nAlfie Kohn\\'s View of Homework\\n\"No Homework\" shoudl be the default rather than the exception. \\nTeachers need to think of a good reason to opt in. Questions to ask:\\nWill the assignment be beneficial to most of them?\\nHow will the assignment impact their interest in learning and in the topic at hand?\\nDesign what you assign - This is likely to reduce quantity and improve quality of homework.\\nKohn\\'s Examples of \"Good\" homework:\\n  1) Activities that are naturally suited to the home\\nExamples:\\nInterview family members on family history,\\nAsk a family member how they learned a math concept in their time and than explain them how we learn it nowadays\\nDesign your own experiment at the home kitchen that will replicate/extend results from a class experiment. \\n2) Family activities we don\\'t normally consider homework (\"home learning\")\\n\"spending time in the company of grown-ups\" - crossword puzzles, word or card games, reading out loud, cooking, \\nOptional - written reflection on the experiences.\\n  3) Reading \\nSustained reading of REAL BOOKS (not chunks of prose devoid of context) helps children become more proficient readers.\\n- own choosing\\n- no mandatory minimum #pages or #minutes (parents of young children may be informed about recommended guidelines, but students should not feel forced to achieve a certain minimum)\\n- opportunity to talk with classmates about reading. \\n  Choice \\n- involve students in decisions regarding assignments rather than telling them what they will have to do.\\n- In one research \"star\" teachers did not give homework in traditional sense (p 59 from textbook) - instead they provided assignments that were planned with the children and grow out of some class activity.\\n- discuss with students not only the when, how or which, but also the whether.\\n  Anecdotal examples from schools and classes  that cancelled traditional homework show that students enjoy the open-ended nature of the assignments and gain a sense of ownership that promotes meaningful learning.\\n  Kino School, Tucson Arizona, abolished regular homework.\\n\"Our goal as educators is to make learning interesting enough that students often want to continue with a project in the evening\"\\n  A Grade 3 teacher that eliminated all homework except reading own choice books has many students invent and complete their own academic projects. \"parents report that they have never seen their child so positive about school\".\\n    Kohn\\'s reason why homework should not be a default practice:\\n1) Less interest in learning \\nHomework has adverse impact on intellectual curiosity and there is a risk that students may generalise it to school itself. \\n(\"The most important attitude that can be formed is that of desire to go on learning\" - John Dewey)\\n    2) Burden on parents  - many parents resent the implicit expectations that they become homework monitors and helpers after a long day at their jobs. Moreover, many homework assignments contain instructions that are difficult for even highly educated parents to understand. \\n  3) Stress for children.\\n  4) Family conflict - parent child relationship is already complex without giving parents a new role as a teacher/enforcer. In addition, homework are taking time away from  potential constructive relaxed family activities that could improve this relationship.\\n  5) Less time for other activities - reading for pleasure, exercising, socializing, volunteering, spending time with parents, and other kinds on non-academic learning.\\n    Kohn\\'s reason why existing research on homework (claiming it improves achievement) is flawed:\\n  1) At best studies show association, not causation.\\nCooper himself concedes that \"it is equally plausible\" that teachers assign more homework to students who are achieving better... or that better students simply spend more time on home study\"\\n\\nFor example, when comparing achievements in 2 schools - one that gives more homework and one that gives less homework, we may be ignoring the fact that one school may be in a more affluent neighbourhood where parents can afford extra tutoring or parents themselves are more educated and can help their children better.\\n  Several studies have even found NEGATIVE relationship between time spent on homework and achievements.\\n  2) Research is over-dependent on self-reporting (by teachers, students, parents) leading to very inaccurate/inconclusive results.\\n  3) Even when they do exist, positive effects are very small and do not justify the extra effort by students and teachers (by Kohn\\'s analysis the benefit amounts to about 4% increase).\\n  4) No evidence of homework\\'s academic benefits in lower grades. Kohn criticises the recent increase of homework in lower elementary grades in the US, supposedly to \"raise standards\" even though there is no evidence that it provides any benefit\\n    5) There is NO EMPIRICAL DATA to support the claims made by some researchers that homework builds character or work habits such as  \"initiative/responsibility\".\\n  The vast majority of research focuses on grades/test results. \\n  6) Even in the absence of research data, the myth of \"homework promotes responsibility and independence\" is pervasive. Let\\'s rethink the logic: kids almost never get a chance to decide whether to have homework or not, or when to do it. One mother commented that homework assignments are really testing her proficiency at time management, not the kid\\'s. \\n          SOURCES\\nBennett, S., & Kalish, N. (2006).

Questions to ask:\\nWill the assignment be beneficial to most of them?\\nHow will the assignment impact their interest in learning and in the topic at hand?\\nProvide real choice to the students - discuss with them not only the what, the when, and the how, but also the whether. \\nDesign what you assign - This is likely to reduce quantity and improve quality of homework.\\nKohn\\'s Examples of \"Good\" homework:\\n  1) Activities that are naturally suited to the home\\nExamples:\\nInterview family members on family history,\\nAsk a family member how they learned a math concept in their time and than explain them how we learn it nowadays\\nDesign your own experiment at the home kitchen that will replicate/extend results from a class experiment. \\n2) Family activities we don\\'t normally consider homework (\"home learning\")\\n\"spending time in the company of grown-ups\" - crossword puzzles, word or card games, reading out loud, cooking, \\nOptional - written reflection on the experiences.\\n  3) Reading \\nSustained reading of REAL BOOKS (not chunks of prose devoid of context) helps children become more proficient readers.\\n- own choosing\\n- no mandatory minimum #pages or #minutes (parents of young children may be informed about recommended guidelines, but students should not feel forced to achieve a certain minimum)\\n- opportunity to talk with classmates about reading. \\n  SOURCES\\nBennett, S., & Kalish, N.

So far, I like that age group the best, because they\\'re beginning to make sense of the world at large, and you can get into wonderful in-depth conversations, without the angst or irrationality brought on by teenagers\\' hormones. However, I wouldn\\'t mind being a subject teacher in a high school; after graduation, I plan to obtain my Music and Mathematics AQs, to keep my options wide open.\\n  This summer I will be teaching ESL full-time, playing pick-up softball, writing music, biking all over the city, and learning about the legal underpinnings and contingencies of our profession - exciting times!\\n  Looking forward to having many interesting discussions with you all, and getting to know the PJs I haven\\'t met yet.

I\\'m speaking as an individual and not as an MTSA right now - there\\'s a few of us in JI who were planning on doing a MTRP group over the summer.  In that particular group we had strong overlap of subjects (controversial/political topics, in my case science, in another case citizenship ed and another in English related but all with that stream of interest) but another group of us were simply talking about doing a group to keep on top of research methods/publication opportunities etc.  I\\'ll keep you in the loop if we do the informal meeting, it\\'d be helpful to know what your particular research area is.\\n  Also - did you see the CIDE seminar coming up?  Everyone welcome.

The discursive framing of girls\\' education, however, limits the potential for fully achieving gender equity. This study analyzes 300 policy documents from 14 agencies from 1995 to 2008, reports on their discursive arguments for educating girls, and examines the conceptualizations and assumptions embedded in policy. We show that the robustness of \"gender\", and related concepts are limited, thereby limiting the potential of the education that is intended to be gender equitable. Policy remains focused on girls and not gender (or boys), and on easily measurable indicators (counting boys and girls in school) and not social processes that maintain gender inequities. Because the discursive framing of policy influences how policy makers understand the issues, how practitioners implement policy, and how progress is assessed, we call for a richer notion of gender in framing educational policy.,\\n8,381,1,Hi folks - just a reminder (or perhaps for the first time!) that MTs are eligible to apply for R&D Graduate Assistanships to work with a prof.

How large are the files anyway?\\n  -Cak,\\n8,413,1,  In the video, The Concept of Fairness, it is explained that fairness does not mean everyone get \"the same\", but what he or she needs. This notion of fairness requires the person a certain level of subjectivity. That being said, how could an educator ensure that their decisions truly reflect fairness? How could one be certain that their efforts to be fair do not create unequitable inequalities?\\n     ,\\n8,414,1,I agree with the notion of fairness video. Some students need certain accomodations that the rest of the class does not need. Teachers need to provide these accmodations to ensure fairness. While I understand this concept, how do we go about this in commucation with our students? When another student complains that the accomodation he sees his friend getting is \"not fair\" how do we react? For example, student X recieves extra time to complete his math test. Student Y claims he too could benefit from that extra time and he feels this situation is unfair. How does fairness get adressed in the classroom in a way that doesnt single out or expose students who need accomodations?,\\n8,416,1,Hey Shira,\\n  I agree with the video and your sentiments. Treating students equitably to support each individual student\\'s learning can be a challenging task. One of the challenges that can arise from fairness is addressing student differences with the class. I believe that a classroom founded on community values of respect, support, and love of learning are essential to an equitable learning environment. I think that the teacher should discuss with the class that every one of us comes from different backgrounds, families, cultures, religions, personal experiences, and educational experiences. The students should be made aware that as a teacher, you will be doing everything you can to help support every student reach their full potential and that the school experience will not be the same for everyone. With this understanding, I would hope that students will be sensitive to their peers and everyone\\'s own unique learning needs. ,\\n8,417,1,  I really love this topic (ehem - my MTRP- ehem), so I like to think that i have some ideas of how we could achieve this. Most importantly, as teachers we have to have open communication with our students on the topic of \"being different\"- meaning, no two students are alike in the way they learn. One suggestion would be to draw parallels that may make more sense to students, perhaps, that some people need glasses, others do not, and while *everyone* can always benefit from extra time, not everyone *needs* the extra time. I believe in the importance of integrating our students into the classroom as seamlessly as possible. So, if there is an accomodation that can be implimented to the entire class, without the whole class realizing that the sole purpose of the accomodation is for one certain student in particular, then everyone can slightly benefit while the student who needs it is granted that boost. Also, we need to be extrememly organized so if we have students that we know work at eccelerated rates we have work available, and for those who are slower, we prepare work at the same level just less to complete. These are of course some things i have been thinking of over the passed little while, and while i know i may not be right, the one thing that i know we can all agree upon if that equity in the classroom is essential, but singling out students as being different can be detrimental so we must be mindful of how we go about doing so.\\n  The Notion of Fairness video is extremely relevant and highlights the importance of not treating every student the same way, rather, treating every student how he or she needs to be treated in order to better set them on the path to their successes- after all, even success criteria varies! Students need to understand the real meaning fair, and one of the best ways to achieve that is simply having that discussion right in the beginning.,\\n8,418,1,Let\\'s try this again...\\n  ...and success!  Resolution should be okay.\\n  Jean,\\n8,419,1,This video reminds me of our assessment class where we learned that equity does not mean equality and that treating students equally will not be fair to all students. My question is: let\\'s say that student x has a learning disability and requires extra time for a math test. However, student x does not want the extra time because \"x\" feels that he/she would be treated differently. As a teacher, how should one react and respond to a request knowing that the extra time would greatly benefit the student? Would it be fair to student x to isolate him/her from ones peers?,\\n8,420,1,Election will take place tomorrow (Wednesday Sep 19th) during the first break of the morning class (or afternoon class if your cohort is off in the morning).\\n  Class representatives will proivde you with ballots and collect your votes into an envelope and seal it.\\n  Yuri and I will collect the sealed envelopes at 4pm at room 5-170, count the votes, and announce the winner. Please note that since Yuri and I are handling the election procedures and vote counting, we will not participate in this election.  All other MT students are eligible and encouraged to participate in this vote.\\n     ,\\n8,421,1,As Shael has mentioned, this video discusses what we learned in one of our first assessment classes last year. Equity and Equality are two different things. In this video, \"faireness\" has the same meaning as equity. \\n  I think what Michelle has said is very important as well. We really need to begin by explaining this to our students. I work as a special education assistant, and many times other students in the classroom will become very angry when they notice something \"unfair\" with regards to the special need child that I am working with. I have had to write out notes for a deaf/blind student, and other students thought it was \"unfair.\" Sometimes I have behavioral students with a behavior plan. The teacher will give them certain \\'rewards\" if they follow a list of approprite behaviors. (Eg. The student will get 5 minutes of computer time if she raises her hand and doesn\\'t hit anybody). I have had other students come over and explain how it is not fair that that student gets computer time while the other don\\'t. \\n\\nI feel that it will probably be easier (for me at least) to make decisions that illustrate faireness with regards to learning disorders. When it comes to behavioral disorders, however, I think I have the same question as Lorne. How does the teacher know that allotting computer time for the student is \"fair\" and not just unequal to the other students who behave every day. I assume it would depend on what the behavior problem is, and if they were actually identified, etc etc. This is an area of concern for me. (Perhaps I will be better informed in special ed class as well). \\n\\nLorne, sorry if I misunderstood your question and it is not at all similar to my question.,\\n8,422,1,Question 1:\\nPlease read the follwoing quotes:\\n\"What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with appropriate prior and current conditions of learning\"\\n - Benjamin Bloom\\n  \"I can\\'t escape the conclusion that different kinds of kids\\' minds are destined to lead different kinds of adult lives\" , \"Each of us is endowed with a highly complex inborn circuitry\", \"Some children end up paying exorbitant price for having the kind of mind they were born with\"\\n\"...Some are wired to create symphonies.... drive trucks and taxicabs...\"\\n\"We apply tremendous pressure on our children to be good at everything\"\\n - Mel Levine\\n  Which approach is more beneficial to children? Should educators focus on attempting to recognize early signs of specific dispositions in children and nurturing them, or emphasize that all children can succeed in learning the standard curriculum?\\n  Question 2:\\nLevine describes children\\'s school experience as ruthlessly evaluative, forcing children to adopt/accept labels that mark them permanently deviant or dysfunctional, and leading them to equate education with humiliation.\\n  Growing Success states that \"The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning.\"\\n  How might teachers in regular ontario classrooms establish assessment and evaluation practices that are not \"ruthless\" or perceived by students as humiliating?\\n  Question 3:\\nLevine describes \"aha\" moments that his patients experience when engaging in open and honest conversations about their own gaps and strengths. Should teachers intergrate such open conversations with students to their instructional repertoire, and is so, how?,\\n8,423,1,Carly I really appreciated your comments regarding rewards and computer time, it\\'s something I struggle with a lot and still don\\'t really know how to react.  I actually saw that a little bit in my first practicum, and it was NOT explained to the rest of the class; that being said, in a grade 8 context, everybody was pretty clear that the individuals in question had some behavioural issues.  In fact, I think I struggled more with it than the students - in some ways it seemed to be rewarding them for simply refraining from behaving like jerks, and that should be a baseline.  I think part of it was my own lack of understanding of just what kind of behavioural issues these kids actually had, which was exposed a little bit later.  But that doesn\\'t answer the question - how do you accomodate certain behavioural difficulties without \"outing\"?  To which I really have no good answer.  \\n  However, for the various learning styles/needs/disabilities, I keep coming back to the phrase \"but that\\'s just good teaching!\"  Why do we have even have time limits for any students - ie, what are we actually gaining from that, is it truly a better test (assessment) of their capacity?  Why do we print things small?  Why don\\'t we use more graphic organizers?  I\\'m doing ESL primary support with my practicum teacher, and he keeps saying \"we\\'ll try not to take them out of kindergarten and gr.1 - right now, they\\'re in the perfect (scaffolded) learning environment with most of the supports that they need.\"  Why is that true in a k-1, but not in a 2-12?  What changes could we be making to our overall pedagogy and assesment methods which would support all students and make a lot of the \"changes\" for specific students uncessary because they\\'re already in place? I know that would never account for all support, but I get this niggling feeling that it would deal with a lot of it.,\\n8,426,1,  Carly-I was disappointed to hear of some of the experiences that you have had in the classroom. Luckily, I have been in classrooms where students have been very accepting and encouraging of accommodations for their peers. (E.g. computers for students who struggled with writing.) However, you raise an interesting point, the accommodations that I have seen have all been cognitive learning tools, not accommodations for behavior needs etc. \\n  I would hope most students would be understanding of accommodations for learning, and if they aren\\'t, perhaps the emphasis should be on community. Behavior needs may be much more complicated than learning needs (e.g. have trouble seeing a black board-you get a print copy. vrs. have trouble being around others ... ? ) \\n  In my opinion just as serious a need, but more difficult to address \\'equitably.\\'\\n  What about making things \\'fair\\' for people of different socio-economic statuses? Backgrounds? Languages? etc. \\n  Each is a point of difference and inequity that becomes more difficult to address as an educator.\\nSome things we have been taught to do is make our teaching culturally relevant. We’ve also been taught to think about how our students are entering the classroom (what has gone on already that morning for them/ for students who have already been through a lot by 9am, what can we do to bring them into the present.)\\nThoughts?,\\n8,428,1,Hey All,\\n  Even though class is cancelled tomorrow morning, here is the scanned chapter for the first required reading for the Sept. 20th class.\\n  Hope this helps,\\n  Olivia\\n ,\\n8,429,2,On behalf of the MTSA, I would like to congratulate Tim Phan, who was formally elected today as our vice president of professional development.\\n  I would also like to thank the other candidates, Wassim and Nadia,  for running in this election.\\n  And finally, I would ilke to thank the class representatives who organized the process very smoothly and to all of the MT students who participated.\\n     ,\\n8,430,1,Would you guys use the heart attack analogy in your own class, if a student questioned it?,\\n8,431,1,,\\n8,432,1,  There are two main points that each of you have talked about that I think are really important... the notion of fairness and how we address this within our classrooms, as well as touching upon Emilie\\'s point of how do we support the students who may have undergone many things by 9am.\\n  The idea of students being understanding and/or accepting of accommodations within the classroom, I think, brings us to the point of awareness.  As we have spoken about many times before, how a teacher approaches making students aware, and how they set up their classrooms as a safe space will definitely play a vital role in the students perspectives of accommodations for learning.  We need to create this environment right from the get-go.  A valid point that was brought up by Ed in a discussion we had earlier is the idea of being honest.  If we as teachers can be honest with our students about how we see our class and how we need to work as a community, a cohesive \\'team,\\' then wont students be able to connect with us and feel as though they are a part of this community, no matter the accommodations neccessary. (I hope this makes sense)  \\n  To address the point of being equitable within the classroom, I believe is a challenging one, but so very neccessary.  How can we ensure that each and every individual student is being treated \\'fairly\\' and provided an equal opportunity to partake in the community of the classroom, just as every other student in the class?  This part Emilie has definitely touched upon in terms of referring to what we have talked about time and again, the notion of making our teaching culturally relevant.  It would be ignorant to ignore the huge diversity of the students within our classroom.  In making our lessons and classroom environment culturally relevant we are taking one more step closer to allowing these students to have a sense of equity and belonging wtihin the classroom.  And still there is so much more that we can do.  \\n  The one thing that resonated with me the most after Monday\\'s class is understanding that a lot can absolutely happen for a child before 9am.  We need to be conscious of this fact and make it known that we as teachers know it can be hard to delve right into school work first thing in the morning.  I believe we have discussed this in class before, but by simply saying goodmorning and welcoming the students into the room can set the tone for the day.  Another possible option could be to simply chat about something of interest to your class, or simply allowing your students to chat amongst themselves for a few moments to ease into the day.  I definitely do not have an absolute answer for this but am 100% behind you Emilie in wanting to learn more on how we can \\'bring them into the present,\\' each and everyday.\\n  If we as educators want to help students understand that we are aware of the fact that they live lives outside the classroom and that some of those situations can enter the classroom with them each morning, how can we go about making our students know that we are there to help them in any way we can, (without making them feel singled out or that their private lives are being intruded upon)? Thoughts?\\n ,\\n8,433,1,I wanted to write a comment for this thread, but Michelle said everything that I was going to say (and more!). Brilliant! \\n\\nCan I suggest that we should help students help themselves? While being \\'fair\\' perhaps means doing some extra work for students (various accommodations of sorts), we won\\'t be around their whole lives to help them out. So should we invest that time to teach them extra coping strategies or help them improve in their areas of weakness (so that they don\\'t \\'need\\' so much)? Are these issues better dealt with by Resource Teachers or EAs? Should we expect results, and thus gradually release responsibility, though never fully, from us to them, if we do teach to these things? ,\\n8,434,1,whats the heart attack analogy??? fill me in...,\\n8,435,1,Hey Olivia,\\n\\nI can\\'t seem to open your attachment - a page pops up that says \"404 - Page not found\".\\n  Jean were you able to get it?\\n  Heather,\\n8,436,1,Thanks for bringing that up Jean. NO, no I would not. It is in the video Michelle. He talks about whether or not it would be fair to help someone who was going into cardiac arrest because it wouldn\\'t be \\'fair\\' to everyone else, because he couldn\\'t help everyone. \\n  *I don\\'t want to dissect it because it was a pretty ridiculous analogy, but, perhaps he was speaking to the seriousness of not helping ppl with learning needs... but probably should have chosen something that was not life or death. ,\\n8,437,1,Hey Michelle, it\\'s from the video we had to watch this week - basically the speaker gives the example of denying a woman in his class (who is having a heart attack) any help because it wouldn\\'t be fair for the other students because he couldn\\'t give them all CPR. It was sort of a ridiculous analogy, but I saw his point. \\n \\nWhen I worked as a mentor to students in Regent Park through Pathways to Education, I took an Anti-Oppressive Education Workshop.  The speaker, an OISE grad I might add, gave us this example of how to explain equity to students and combat the \"not fair\" comments when students want equality not equity. I love it.  \\n  She walked up to one of the participants in our workshop and said \"before we go on break I just have a question, what size shoes do you wear?\"  The guy replied, \"11\" and she continued, \"Ok, so what is your favouirte type of running shoe? The best you\\'ve found?\"  He replied, \"I like Nike.\"  She then went on to say to everyone in the workshop, \"oK, so next week I thought we should get a bit more active and do some activities outside during our workshop. I just wanted to check and see what size and type of shoes we all need because I want to make sure we are prepared. I can go get them this weekend.\"  Immediately, a petite lady laughed and said, \"there\\'s no way size 11 mens would fit me.\"  The presenter continued, \"Oh well I thought I\\'d be fair and just get everyone the same.\" The woman then said \"That\\'s not fair, though!\"   And so on and so on... you see where I\\'m going.  She essentially proved that accomodations are fair in the most organic way and then left us to mull over that for our own break. I thought it was brilliant and I\\'ve used it in a lot of settings with students since.  I can think of a bunch of examples you can use in your class to encourage the same dialogue with your students in different settings - maybe you guys have other ideas too?\\n     ,\\n8,438,1,Hi All,\\n  Great discussion thread! Like Michelle, I am very interested in how we actually create equitable classrooms that advantage all. In reading all your posts I kept coming back to empathy. Maybe I\\'m very idealistic, but I believe that if empathy is something instilled in students from the get go, maybe less of the \"not fair\" comments will pop up in class. Coming from an experiential learning background, I\\'ve always been a fan of doing team builders or experiential activities where students have to experience things from another students shoes and have found that long after those activities students still remember tid bits of what it feels like for their peers...long after any \"talk\" I gave about empathy. For example, I used to work at Frank Oke, a high school for students with special needs in Toronto, and in one of my workshops I had a student who was blind (and had an EA). One day the student, call him H, got really frustrated during a game because students kept getting him out the quickest. After the workshop I talked ot him about it and he said \"nobody get\\'s it and it would be easier if they just did.\" We talked for awhile about how we could help his peers understand the struggles he deals with and he came up with something similar to a trust walk that he could lead them all in. Now I have to say, he was one courageous kid and I don\\'t know if all kids would take this on themselves (a teacher might have to initiate the activities), but the next workshop he led them in a blind-folded trust walk around the school and it was phenomenal. Powerful even. We debriefed the experience a bit afterwards and H told his classmates that he didn\\'t want them to avoid getting him out, but more just be aware of what he can or can\\'t do and maybe play some games that he wants to play or can play more easily every once in awhile. I admit, I likely probably hadn\\'t done a good enough job facilitating that from the get go, but we live and learn right?    Anyway, I feel like I\\'m story telling a lot this morning... more just want to say that I believe students will get the reason behind our choices if they can feel for one another and really step in their shoes, not necessarily just because we say so.     These brilliant opportunities don\\'t always pop up and like Nikki, I wonder about \"outing\" students, but I guess at the end of the day I\\'m learning more towards openly discussing everyone\\'s accomodations no matter what they are than protecting or keeping an accomodation on the DL.\\n   ,\\n8,439,1,Hi All,\\n  I know readings are ramping up, but I found this report fascinating in the summer. I\\'ve only lived in Toronto for 7 years now, and I\\'m obviously only 25, so to see what has shifted in Toronto in the last few decades was fascinating. It also highlights implications for our teaching in decades to come.  For all of those who hope to teach in Toronto like me, I wonder what this means for our students in the near and far future. Who will our students be? What issues will they be facing? What does that mean for our practices? And so on...,\\n8,440,1,That is a great example, Heather. It reminds me of a similar shoe one that I found many years ago. I posted on pepper last year, but in case you didn\\'t get to read it I will post it again. I guess this one could be for younger students.\\n\\nThis is directly from somebody\\'s blog. (Not written by me)\\n\\n\\nThe Difference Between \\'Equity\\' and \\'Equality\\'\\n  Pay attention, folks, because this lesson is important. It\\'s important for feminism, for humanity, for respect and tolerance. So read closely, because I don\\'t get this fired up over nothing.\\n\\nThere\\'s this activity I do in my class. All the students sit in a circle, and I ask everyone to take off his or her left shoe and throw it into a pile in the center. Once the shoes are all piled up, I begin re-distributing them, one to each student, completely at random. Then I tell everyone to put on the new shoes. And inevitably, there begin the complaints.\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t my shoe!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s too big!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s too small!\"\\n\\n\"This doesn\\'t fit me!\"\\n\\nWhatever the specific complaints are, very few students are actually happy with their newly mismatched pair of shoes. \"What\\'s wrong?\" I ask. \"I did everything fairly. You all have two shoes - one for your right foot and one for your left.\"\\n\\n\"But Miss David,\" they say, \"they aren\\'t the correct shoes!\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" I say. \"You want the shoes that are best for each of you individually? Not just any shoe I find?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" they all say.\\n\\n\"But,\" I say, with furrowed brow, \"that doesn\\'t seem fair. I wanted to treat you all EQUALLY.\" I point to a boy with somewhat large feet, and a nearby girl with smallish feet. \"He\\'ll have more shoe than you will,\" I note. And without a doubt, someone unknowingly gets right to the heart of the issue:\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter who has more shoe, Miss David. It matters that we all have the rightshoes for us.\"\\n\\nAnd THAT, my friends, is the difference between equity and equality. Equality means everyone gets exactly the same outcome - two shoes - without regard to individual differences - large or small feet, for example. Equity means everyone gets the same quality of outcome - shoes that fit their individual needs.\\n ,\\n8,441,1,Brief summary:\\nThis article challenges both the notion that race is a biologically or otherwise a deterministic concept and the notion that race is an illusion - an ideological construct and a false consciousness.\\n  The authors propose an alternative conception of race, called \"racial formation\". It proposes race a fluid concept. Both individual racial identities and collective group identities are a process that both shaps and is shaped by political, economic, and social forces. This definition attempts to acknowledge that despite the lack of intrinsic scientific (biological) merit to the concept, 500 years of social enforcement have arranged social structures and identity formations in a way that makes race a social reality.\\n  Repsonse:\\nWhile I can see the merit of the racial formation theory I have little personal experience with the concept of racial identity. Personally, I have never considered my race as a major part of my identity and do not identify with the authors claim that being without a racial identity is \"akin to being genderless\" and \"to be in danger of having no identity\".\\n  On the other hand, I can relate it to my personal experience of ethnic/national/religious identity, which I also feel is a very fluid concept. I often feel uncomfortable when people ask me \"Are you Jewish?\". I feel like I cannot simply answer yes or no. I grew up in Israel in a secular family. We considered our culture as Israeli rather than Jewish. I chose Canada as my home. I do not practice any religion and do not feel part of Jewish culture. On the other hand, I cannot completely deny my family history, background, and heritage.\\n  If you asked my mother the same question, her answer would be more clear cut:\"It doesn\\'t matter how I want to define myself - Hitler has already defined it for my grandfather. Therefore I am Jewish\".\\n  To summarise, what I take away from this article is the recognition that aspects of identity can be fluid rather than deterministic, and we should remain open to many different forms of defining identity.,\\n8,443,3,Your summary of the article is fantastic, Zack. \\n  In response to your response, and also the article, I would like to respond by saying that  the fluidity of \"race\"is something that shapes my day-to-day life.\\n  The idea of racial construction as an illusion that is ideological, but that also pervades our lives is very real to me. Somewhat ironically, I neither occupy the \"black\" box, nor the \"white\" box when I look at race. I\\'m other. Most people are other. I fit, but I don\\'t fit. I\\'m part of a huge diaspora of Armenian people, but I neither fit in my \"community\" here in Canada (a place almost without its own racial identifier), nor do I fit with my original home country (my parents were born and raised in Turkey). But somehow, I always say, I\\'m Armenian, before I say I\\'m Canadian. I\\'ve always found that, at least racially, I\\'ve always felt displaced - and yet, I feel most myself in Canada. Identity, I feel, much like the authors and Zack, is fluid, because it changes on context and circumstance. In the same way, it is a way of helping others figure out who and what I am - in a sense, what they should do, categorically with me. People seem to need it more than I do, because I\\'ve grown to see myself as without. As I fill out \"white\" or \"middle-eastern\", in bubbles I consider, what will I be today? It matters so much more to the survey readers then to me. \\n  Being a teacher, I think that\\'s what I bring. Race is a way that society organizes our students, and sometimes, how our students organize themselves, but race is a construct, it need not oppress them or give them a feeling of being displaced, it is merely a ideological construct that they can transcend, if they choose to. I guess the question, then, is how?\\n ,\\n8,444,1,THANK YOU SO MUCH LIV!!!! \\nHeather, I was able to open the attachement if you still can\\'t I can try emailing it to you, let me know.\\n ,\\n8,445,2,Hi Shael, \\n  I had a very similar questions when watching this video. As educators, we do our best to offer a variety of instructional practices and in so doing, we ensure  students get what they need to be successful. I value the video\\'s perspective that equality means that all students get what they need rather then that all students get the same thing. I would openly discuss this with my students - such that they are aware that they will not get the same thing but they will get what they need to be successful. I will encourage open dialogue with my students such that they come to me when they need something or inform me of ways they believe they learn best. \\n  As a response to your question, I would speak to the student and inform them that I am doing my best to assist them. If a student is not willing to comply, I would discuss strategies with the parent(s) to find out other ways to help the child. Lastly, I would ask the student to provide ways that he/she thinks is best to enhance their learning. In other words, I would come down to the student\\'s level and hear their perspectives in the learning process. This will ensure that we minimize the barrier between student and teacher and further exemplify a classroom community where student and teacher are partners in the learning. ,\\n8,446,1,I absolutely love these activities/analogies for fairness and how to approach the issue in our own classrooms.\\n  Additionally, one of the anaolgies we saw in Shelley\\'s class was the example of the wheel chair at the bottom of the stair case.  The idea is not that the individual is disabled but rather that the environment around the individual is disabled.  I like the idea that in order to make things \"fair\" we need our environments to support individual needs. i.e by providing a computer to a student with autism who has difficulty communitcating otherwise we are providing a platform for this particular child to communicate just as well as other students can without computers.  To me, this is the definition of fairness, not everyone having the same thing (i.e. everyone getting a computer) - the same message as the shoes.\\n     ,\\n8,447,6,Hey Everyone, I wanted to get the discussion from this upcoming week\\'s readings and facilitation started. \\n  I just finished reading Poverty by Postal code.  2 of the reccomendations are as follows:\\n  1) Make housing affordable throughout various neighbourhoods so that low income families do not gravitate to, and become concentrated in the least expensive areas of the city and 2) Provide livable incomes (increase minimum wage). \\n  In response, I wanted to pose the following questions:\\n  1) Is there a precedent in any other scenario other than housing where affordable is infused with exclusive? In other words, is there anyway to create a housing market that has low income and high-income housing beside one another? Can you think of any examples of this?\\n  (* please forgive my choice of words i.e. exclusive, I cannot think of better term right now)\\n  and\\n  2) If we raise the minimum wage for everyone, does the cost of living simeoultaneously increase with it? Would this leave us in the same or an improved position?\\n ,\\n8,448,1,The heart attack example, if not crude, was a rather \"removed\" analogy.\\n  Empathy in general takes time to develop for students (as well as teachers), so younger students in particular may see accommodations as \"non-essential\" and just focus on their own lack of assistance as the root of unfairness. I think it\\'s most effective to just give the \"assignment deadline extension\" analogy; there will be times when a student needs an extension for an assignment because of illness, may be absent for extracurriculars, etc. and it\\'s something virtually all students can relate to or understand.\\n  Or glasses for those who are short-sighted.\\n  In my experience though, I find students are quite empathetic or at least accepting of their own classmates with special needs/needs for accommodations.\\n  -Cak,\\n8,449,1,FYI - I pulled a few book reviews from the journal referenced in class, attached for your reading pleasure.,\\n8,450,1,Re: \"What about making things \\'fair\\' for people of different socio-economic statuses? Backgrounds? Languages? etc.\"\\n  As much as some of us may feel a moral imperative to do all we can to provide support for students who have more than enough on their plate from home (abusive parents, arduous commutes, etc.), some things are just out of bounds for teacher intervention/assistance for legal reasons or to prevent the \"incremental creeping\" of students asking for more and more help.\\n  I\\'m still not sure where that line is though.,\\n8,451,1,Awesome, thanks! ,\\n8,452,1,To me the concept of race is a convenient way to sort and describe people with marked vs. unmarked traits regardless of how they arise. The roots of these racial traits vary with the context, but as they persist over a wide population and over time, the mechanisms by which these traits arise seem to matter less than the sheer fact that many certain traits seem to \"correlate\" with each other. Differences are differences, and as long as the correlation is compelling enough, they\\'re simply noted as racial characteristics.\\n  I think it\\'s important for teachers and students to discuss/revisit how the notion of race became so deeply embedded within the human psyche that we developed a collective blind spot in its usage. The idea (I emphasize idea) that African Americans and Jamaicans have a natural advantage when it comes to sprinting and that Kenyans (especially concentrated around the town of Eldoret) are naturally superior at distance running due to Darwinian selection/gene-muscle-fibre expression/mitochondrial DNA is as real and tangible as the idea that high altitude living, rituals of cattle raiding, circumcision, and certain marriage practices sculpted a Kenyan tribe over two thousand years to possess superior athletic stamina. As the article points out, obviously, there are traits that are consistent among a \"race\" and cannot be explained by biology, but race isn\\'t nonexistent either in the sense that many of us (as individuals) have moments of identification with certain cultural groups.\\n  As a teacher, I wonder how to acknowledge these traits and observed correlations (and possibly propose mechanisms for causation) in the classroom without inadvertently encouraging the idea that they strictly define us.\\n  Jonathan Marks, an anthropologist at U North Carolina, once said\\n  \"All human groups, however constituted, have particular medical risks. African Americans, Ashkenazi Jews, Afrikaners and Japanese, poor people, rich people, chimney sweeps, prostitutes, choreographers, and the Pima Indians all have their particular health risks. And race is not the cause of it; in fact, race will positively obscure it.\"\\n  Given that this is true, it would be one way to suggest that race doesn\\'t determine the traits we see, but the other way round; that traits (not just biological, but cultural too) partly determines our ideological construct of race. On the other hand, you wouldn\\'t call blood type or proficiency in a certain subject area a racial category. How then, would you talk about race and all the real things in life that come with it? (How do I convince a traditional Asian student who is ashamed of not fitting his own stereotype when he performs poorly on a math test that race is just an overblown heuristic?)\\n  -Cak,\\n8,453,1,I know this may be a silly question, but is that 2 pages double spaced?  I have 2 pages and a few lines (double spaced)....cut it down?,\\n8,454,1,I really enjoyed this small clip about fairness. Even after watching it, the one important point that sticks with me is the definition of fairness which is defined differently than what some of us, including myself, probably thought. The idea that everyone should get what they need, rather than get the same as everyone else, is important for our classroom, especially when we are accomodating and modifying for those students who NEED the support.\\n  The video also brings up an important point about parents and how many are playing the juggling/balancing act to support their children and providing different support to their children depending on their varying needs. As the video mentioned, it may not always seem \"fair\" but it is what is necessary.\\n  Lorne, you bring up some really good questions that cannot be so clearly answered. In addition to your questions, I question to what extent should teachers be \"fair\" to those students who need support before extra assisstance be brought into the classroom for those students? What happens if the other students (rest of the class) are being neglected because the teacher is spending so much time with students who need the most? Is their learning compromised?,\\n8,455,2,Dr. Crichlow,\\n  I have not had enough time to think about which 2/3 assignments I would like to complete. An extension would be great.\\n  With thanks,\\nTanya ,\\n8,456,1,Hi Dr. Crichlow,\\n  Hope you are well.\\n  In terms of the Discovery Project outline/plan, I would appreciate some extra time to think about the two different assignments and as to which one I am going to choose.\\n  Thanks so much,\\n  Olivia Gerardi\\n   ,\\n8,457,2,Hi everyone,\\n  After going through the readings for tomorrow\\'s class, I have come up with the following questions to begin our discussions:\\n  1)   What is your neighborhood like? How important is your neighborhood to you and to how you function on a daily basis? How do you function within your neighborhood?\\n  2)   The report documents that, “… the neighbourhood has an influence on the lifeline of a person, independent of other factors…” (p. 6) and that “the stigmatization of living in a distressed neighbourhood is one way that ‘place’ can have an independent, detrimental effect” (p. 6).\\n  If you are a teacher, working in a school within an underserviced and impoverished neighborhood, do you discuss and teach your students about poverty? If so, how would you go about addressing the issues in which they are faced with on a daily basis? How will you consider the effect the issue of poverty has on your students?\\n  3)   What does affordable housing look like to you? What are your thoughts on the recommendation of creating “mixed neighborhood” (p. 57)?,\\n8,458,1,  Dr. Crichlow,\\n  I also have not had enough time to think about, or plan for the assignments. An extension would be greatly appreciated! \\n  Maria Andriano ,\\n8,459,5,  Excellent summary, Zack; a concise synopsis is a great teaching tool!\\n  Regarding your first response paragraph:\\nWhile an individual may choose not to consider race as a major part of their identity, it is nonetheless viewed and construed outside the self, by other individuals and society at large. One person may have the luxury of downplaying the role/power of their perceived race, while another may not.\\n  The article seeks to counter claims of race\\'s invisibility. When it describes conservatives who \"argue that race is an illusion\", I immediately thought of Stephen Colbert\\'s onscreen persona, who continually claims he \"[doesn\\'t] see race\"1, and asks interview subjects what race they are. He is satirizing a process that many enact every day: trying to pretend that race identity formation doesn\\'t account for institutional privileges that certain populations hold.\\n  These privileges are the result, not only of racial identity, but of ability, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, citizenship, and language. However, the article does not claim to investigate every single one of those, instead focusing on the vast topic of race.\\n  Some questions I have after reading this article: Where does it stand in the discourse about race and identity? A lot has happened since 1993 - where should we go to read about it? Can anyone recommend some supplementary material they found particularly illuminating?\\n*\\n  1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert_(character)#cite_note-68\\n   ,\\n8,460,2,A distressing article about how digital rights management (DRM) makes it harder for users with disabilities to adapt digital technologies:\\n  http://www.zdnet.com/going-blind-drm-will-dim-your-world-7000004586/\\n  (This could have huge repercussions for classroom teachers who use adaptive technology, but it\\'s also a sad state of affairs when companies choose the punctuality of a product\\'s release over accessibility),\\n8,461,1,I would really appreciate an extension please! ,\\n8,462,1,  After watching the video and reading all of your responses, I agree with what many people said in regards to teaching our students about fairness. As a teacher it is important to teach our students life lessons (i.e. the meaning of true fairness). It is important to explain the concept of fairness at the beginning of the year to students, so that as situations arise they understand why some people are receiving extra support. Furthermore, if a classroom is built on values of a community, students will be open to helping their fellow peers. \\n  Another valuable lesson comes out of this idea of fairness as well. People are different. They have different strengths and weaknesses, different preferences, different hobbies, different physical looks etc. I think it is important for all students to acknowledge and respect these differences.,\\n8,463,2,Hi everyone,\\n\\nWe\\'re organizing a \"French Lunch\" to give people a chance to practice their French conversation skills. The setting will be very informal and all skill levels are welcome! We\\'ll be meeting next Wednesday, September 26th in the 12th floor lounge at noon. If you\\'re looking to improve, maintain or practice your French please stop by!,\\n8,464,1,I would also like an extension. Thank you very much,\\n8,465,3,While reading this article I kept thinking back to my undergraduate courses in geography, specifically the ones where we discussed the creation of neighborhoods and the movement of people and services in these areas. \\n  I learned a lot about food deserts. Basically, a food desert is the phenomena that people living in lower income areas are less likely to have supermarkets and fresh food venues around them. In their place are less healthy options (i.e. fast food). The reason for this is grocery stores are more likely to receive better business in affluent areas, so from a business perspective, why would they situate themselves in areas where people have less disposable income? People in these areas are also less likely to have access to a car, making it more difficult to access grocery stores. \\n  Living in these lower income areas directly affects the holistic life of residents. In this case their health is put at risk. I agree with the report. The situation is severe and it is vital for change to occur.\\n  I am in the same boat as Tanya; I am questioning whether and how \"mixed\" communities could exist? And if so, would that eliminate the problem?  ,\\n8,466,1,Hello!\\n  I would greatly appreciate an extension. I\\'d like to explore all options in the next week or so and choose something meaningful and challenging. \\n  Thanks for offering an extension,\\n  Heather,\\n8,467,1,Dr. Crichlow,\\n  I would absolutely appreciate an extension as well. I would definitely like to spend more time putting some thought and effort into this project and which of the 2 assignments I would like to do.\\n    Thank you and best,\\nSarah,\\n8,468,1,Hi Wesley, I would also like to have an extension on the discovery project plan and outline section...weighing all the options is going to take a little bit more time.

For example, the theory, \\'education for the other,\\' focusing on improving the experience for students who are othered, or some way oppressed. It talks about creating an harmful space. \\nOn one level, to the theorists, this means providing a separate space where students who face different forms of oppression can go for help, support, advocacy, resources and so forth. In the article they give the examples of student alliances that engage in political action, such as a straight/gay alliance and Asian American alliance etc., which should occupy this space. ,\\n8,470,1,Emilie,\\n  I agree that if students in the classroom aren\\'t understanding of accommodations made for their peers, that the focus must be shifted on developing a safe community in the classroom.  As others have stated in their responses, I believe that it is important that there is an open dialogue in the classroom surrounding accommodations made and fair/equitable practices in the classroom, making sure that all students are getting what they need and are understanding and supportive of their classmates.  I agree that behaviour needs can be more difficult to address equitably and that there are many factors other than direct learning needs, that affect a students\\' experience and that must acknowledged (socio-economic status, lanugages, etc.).  I think you had raised a very important point here and it is something that we must all be aware of in the classroom. \\n  Although the depth of these issues can not be stated simply, I do believe that developing a positive, inclusive, and safe community in the classroom allows for much more ease when addressing the issue of \\'fairness\\'.  Creating a community environment in the classroom could also help reduce the gap that students may be feeling between their experiences in their daily lives, and those in the classroom.  With a solid foundation in the classroom, perhaps students will feel comfortable and supported by their peers (and teacher), and through a morning routine/activities, we can work to bridge the gap as students enter the classroom.  We as teachers must be aware that there is so much going on in our students\\' lives, even prior to their arrival at 9am.\\n ,\\n8,471,1,Just anticipating that just within a few weeks these threads are going to be really crammed... Should we have a separate subforum for each class instead of one long list of threads in the \"JI Section\" forum? It\\'ll get harder to find specific posts we may want to revisit.\\n  -Cak,\\n8,472,1,Hi Dr. Crichlow, \\n  I would appreciate some more time to think of which 2 projects I\\'d like to do, and which event I would like to attend if I do do the Discovery Project. \\n  Thank you for offering an extension!\\n  Stephanie Kim ,\\n8,473,1,Agree. \\n  Maybe we could have different sections for class discussions, announcements, and.. questions for the professor? ,\\n8,474,1,Agreed, this is only the first week and we already have close to 70 posts randomly clustered...it is actually making my brain hurt\\n  Just to add to Steph, we should have sections for \"weekly readings\", \"weekly class discussion\", \"announcements\", \"misc\", etc.....any headings I have missed?\\n   ,\\n8,475,1,Some initial thoughts about the strong neighbourhood reading: \\n  As someone who has done a small amount of work around non-profit work, I feel wary of the \"Strong Neighbourhoods\" project. After having skimmed both readings, I am dying to ask: whose interests are REALLY being represented? It seems as though the goal of the Task Force is to have the neighbourhoods take charge of making change in their areas, with the assistance and guidance of the Task Force. However, there is very little representation of each neighbourhood within the Task Force. \\n  For example, the \"Investment Board\" - which will help decide what projects get funding and which don\\'t - is made up of government officials, school board representatives and United Way representative. Six community members are also a part of the board, but it seems that they are nominated by the other members of the board, not by the community. \\n  \"The Task Force recognizes that community members charged with allocating\\npublic funds must be appointed by governments and accountable to them.\\nThe credibility of the Board also depends on finding community members\\nwho are knowledgeable and who represent the broad diversity of Toronto’s\\nneighbourhoods and communities. For this reason, we recommend that\\nUnited Way of Greater Toronto and the Ontario Trillium Foundation play a\\nfacilitating role in nominating skilled community members from a range of\\nbackgrounds and perspectives.\"\\n  (what does \"facilitating role\" mean here?) \\n  I might be getting nitpicky here, but I find this to be odd. Shouldn\\'t community members have a say in which people represent them and their needs in any boards or committees that will be doing major work in the neighbourhood? I guess I am just wary of any project that claims that it will bring in outside help to a community in need. ,\\n8,476,4,Hello Dr. Crichlow,\\n  Given this course\\'s online participation component for every class, I imagine the growing number of threads and replies here will become overwhelming to navigate through within a few months! Would it be possible to have subforums set up for \"Class Discussion XX\" (one forum for each class), \"Announcements\", and \"Questions for Dr. Crichlow\"? This organization would be very helpful for us to keep track of the discussion, as well as quickly find a comment or announcement if we need to.\\n  Many thanks in advance,\\nCurtis,\\n8,477,1,  -Cak,\\n8,478,1,Agreed! I\\'m just re-posting everything for SALT to Pepper for all of our amazing members who would prefer to check Pepper over Facebook!,\\n8,479,1,Hey All,\\n  Here are my discussion questions for tomorrow\\'s class!\\n  Thank you!\\n    Given the increase in human mobility with the availability of cars and transit, is the local neighbourhood still crucial or indeed viable to the needs of Toronto citizens?\\n  How do we address the issue of spatial concentration of poverty in specific communities? In the current economic climate is it feasible for governments to a) lessen poverty and b) disperse it, so that specific areas do not suffer the stigma of becoming a distressed or deprived neighbourhood?\\n  Given that the private sectors goal is the “bottom line” is it possible to make them a partner in developing mixed income housing?\\n  How do we educate homeowners living in more affluent areas to accept affordable housing in their communities?\\n  When teaching in distressed neighbourhoods, do we need to adjust and/or adapt our teaching style and if so how? Specifically, how do we address the issue of hungry students?\\n  To what extent should teachers be advocates for the neighbourhoods in which their students live?\\n  How do we deal with our own feelings and our colleagues feelings when we see the often harrowing circumstances in which some students live?,\\n8,480,1,Hi there!\\n  I too would greatly appreciate an extension! I would like to speak with you tomorrow in class and hopefully i will have a better idea.\\n  Thanks a lot!,\\n8,481,1,Hello my group!\\n  Sincerely apologize that these questions are getting to you so late. I completely realize I was supposed to have posted the questions 48 hours in advance and that as a result of me not doing so I may be making your lives a little more challlenging tomorrow. \\n  That being said, I thought it would only be fair for me to provide a lot of options for our discussion. I want to make sure we talk about aspects of the reports that truly struck chords with us and really dive into the implications for us as soon-to-be educators.  Here is what I am thinking.\\n    Questions for Discussion:\\n  What struck you about the report(s)? What did you find most interesting? Challenging? What did you question? What have you been thinking about since reading the reports?\\n  What experiences or interactions have you had within the 23 neighbourhoods considered to have “very high” levels of poverty? Have you lived in one/near one? Have you taught in one/near one? If so, what were those experiences like and what have you taken from those experiences?\\n  What implications do these reports have for us as teachers? (Teachers in the city and teachers in other parts of Ontario?)\\n  How will the fact that Toronto has seen a decade plus of declining income affect our teaching and practices? Or does it and will it? What must or should we consider?\\n  What can we, as educators, do to truly combat poverty? How can we be? What must we do?\\n  As an educator, how do you address the marginalization of the poor in your school(s)?\\nHow do you address the income gaps in your classrooms? Or do you expect there will even be one considering the information you’ve gathered from the readins?\\n    What are the implications of urban poor moving to suburbs? (cost of living is cheaper… but what about access to transit, services, etc.)\\n  I\\'ve done my best to clip out interesting parts of the reports in case anyone needs visual aids or material to jog their memories.  Hope that works!,\\n8,482,1,As many of you know I often compare teaching to coaching, especially in physical education. I read an article stating, \"the greatest coaches are consistent in treating everyone differently.\" Relationships are very important, having the ability to know how your players (students) react in specfic situations.  ,\\n8,483,1,Hello Dr. Crichlow, \\n  I would also appreciate an extension. I have not decided which of the three assignments I will be completing.\\n  Thanks in advance, \\n  Alessandro ,\\n8,484,8,These articles provide much insight into several new initiatives government officials are making to better our communities and local neighbourhoods. While gaining new insights into the Task Force and ways in which we can assist marginalized groups in Toronto, these readings allow me to consider the implications on the education system and our students as a whole. Sometimes teachers put pressure on students to complete their homework, assignments and study for upcoming tests. But what we fail to realize at times is that our diverse students have so many other pressures happening in their lives outside of school. Students living in poverty have other necessities to consider other then school-related tasks. Does school add to their pressures? How can we as educators alleviate their external pressures? \\n  My mom has been an Educational Assistant in a low socio-economic neighbourhood in Toronto. It was not uncommon for her to see students come to school without lunch or discussing their family troubles. These students tend to be the ones whom were demoralized in school and unmotivated to achieve. Can you really blame them? As teachers, should we focus on getting students to \"achieve the grade\" or perhaps acknowledge that our students have too much to deal with? How active of a role should we play in a student\\'s life outside of school? I believe it is important to learn about our students\\' lives outside of school to fully understand how we can best assist them in their current state of living. ,\\n8,485,1,Dear Dr. Crichlow,\\n  I would like to request an extension for the discovery project as I have not yet decided on an event, and would like to dedicate careful thought to it.\\n  Sincerely,\\n  Laura,\\n8,486,2,  After reading the report on “Strong Neighborhoods”, a question comes to mind, well many actually: if our population is constantly increasing within our city, mainly due to immigration, as stated in the report, then wouldn’t there be more of a need for public services?  Whether or not the organization and implementation of these services is lagging behind the need or not, due to funding, government knowledge of the need itself, etc, why have we been hearing about schools closing down within the city recently due to low student enrollment?  Wouldn’t school enrollment be increasing because of population growth?  \\n  I can understand why the government would be closing down schools to save money on operating costs etc., but is this a step in the wrong direction, or is the money saved by shutting down schools in one neighborhood being used to invest into the “at risk” neighborhoods, and public services there?  More questions than answers, and even more keep coming up as I think about the topic…,\\n8,487,5,    Poverty by Postal Code – United Way Report 1981 – 2001\\n  United Way. (2005). Strong neighbourhoods: A call to action. GTA 13 Priority Communities.\\n  Poverty by Postal Code paints an alarming picture of Toronto as a city where the disparity between rich and poor is out of scale with the rest of the country: a city where at-risk neighbourhoods plunge even further into poverty, and job growth slows to a crawl. Social assistance rates have flatlined and benefits have actually been reduced. Thirteen priority neighbourhoods, many located in Toronto\\'s inner suburbs, show the effects of being ignored by policy makers. Their residents face serious barriers to employment and housing, and the number of high poverty pockets is increasing.\\n  United Way\\'s 2005 call to action delineates the aims of three bodies1 dedicated to improving outcomes in these high-poverty neighbourhoods. Funding will come from all three levels of government, and initiatives will proceed in partnership and consultation with local communities, combating the negative effects of gentrification and empowering diverse populations to build strong, healthy, appealing neighbourhoods.\\n  Discussion Questions:\\n  1. [How] can we address poverty, and the growing disparity between the rich and poor, in our classrooms? How best to discuss it in an equitable manner which doesn\\'t cause more harm than good? Can it be incorporated into the curriculum, and if so, how?\\n  2. The United Way report compiled data from the long-form Statistics Canada census. Now that the long-form census has been eliminated, how can we accurately gauge the situation in our schools\\' neighbourhoods? What resources are available to teachers seeking to inform themselves of the sociological terrain? What is your reaction to the elimination of the long-form census?\\n  3. How can you best advocate for students in these high-poverty neighbourhoods? What does that look like, and how comfortable are you with being an advocate? To what extent do you plan to liaise with parents/family/guardians/community members?\\n  4. When teaching students in affluent neighbourhoods, how can we equitably discuss Toronto\\'s poverty, without creating an us-and-them atmosphere? How can we remain mindful that even in the most affluent neighbourhoods, there is poverty and inequity?\\n  5. What is the balance between intervention and curricular objectives? How much time are you willing to spend to create a safe space for students living in poverty, and are you prepared to justify your actions to school administrative bodies if they object?\\n  **\\n  1Local Neighbourhood Investment Partnerships, the Strong Neighbourhoods Investment Board, and the Strong Neighbourhoods Unit\\n       ,\\n8,488,1,Extension please - I lost track of things due to not feeling well and needing more time to proccess my own location and plans.,\\n8,489,1,  Hi All,\\n  This isn\\'t the website that I was referring to but it seems like the most popular site that offers this service.

Does it mean to owe a debt to Aaron\\'s brother, whose legal, legitimate presence trying to protect OUR democracy may have cost him a lifetime of being forced to check off that \"do you have a criminal record\" box that is present in pretty much every employment form, with subsequent limitations/discrimination?  That could cost him his international mobility?  Do we really trust our justice system, that those that pay those above prices were guilty of a \"crime\" deserving those results, or perhaps that they were perfectly innocent of everything except a willingness to believe that the state is always acting in the best interests of its citizens?  \\n  I suppose what I like most about this is the feeling that the \"country\" is not synonomous with \"the state\" - and that to struggle with the latter may actually be done out of a great love for the former. ,\\n8,494,1,  Any second year students interested in being at a SALT lunch this Thursday from 12:15-12:50, to have subject/stream specific small group discussions.

On the first day one girl immediately shut off, insisting that her younger brother would do so much better even before she even got a chance to run her first program. At the end of the unit though, it was clear that all the girls developed the confidence to get past the stereotype and even become proficient in basic programming skill and the thought-processes involved. I would think that kind of transformative power was effectively primarily because of the all-girls setting...

It seems I did pretty well, though I totally got pwned in \"Novice\" mode. It makes sense for it to turn out that way though given that the Novice AI learns from a single human opponent whereas the so-called Veteran uses playing histories based on thousands of opponents (which would be counterproductive with a game like RPS with so few choices per turn and not much room for complex strategy).

IS is also fine if we are placed in an intermediate school. However, OSSTF, who certifies secondary teachers, have no official statement re: MT. Basically last year, a member of OSSTF (not a spokesperson re this particular matter) told last year\\'s IS grads that they would enter in at A3. Dick and Jim are trying to get in touch with OSSTF to have this confirmed/denied, but are having issues reaching them. However they have been in touch with past MT grads in IS who are currently working (the few who got jobs) and they all entered in at A4, so their point was until we hear of an MT grad entering in at A3, it is safe to assume we all enter in at A4.\\n  3) Science Centre Visit. Sara hasn\\'t been able to get required information from OSC. Shiva may be able to help. Given the current schedule, this will probably take place after the first practicum.\\n  4) Photocopy fee - it is unclear whether and how much reimbursment are we expected to receive at the end of the program. The current situation is frustrating, where in some cohorts students are printing 50 page articles at home. Some students prefer course readers.\\nAction Item: Yuri to bring this issue up with faculty at communication meeting and clarify the issue of potential reimbursment (i.e., how is it tracked? How realistic is it? How will it be returned and to whom?)\\n  5) Lunch&Learns:\\nOctober 3rd - \"Population Connection\" - raising students awareness of local/global issues\\nEco Literacy\\nMath & Literacy connection (gr 7-12) by OISE instructor Ron Lancaster - potentially an afternoon if there is enough interest.\\nAction Item: Curtis will advertise the events on pepper and MTSA website.\\n  6) STAO and OHASSTA PD conference are available during parcticum.

The structure will then collapse due to these forces.  Great for kids to visualize these forces in action.\\n  http://www.candystand.com/play/insurgo-remix,\\n8,524,1,This was something I was introduced to during observation week this year. \\nA program that allows students to create stories in an interactive and creative way. It claims to encourage reluctant readers and writers. \\nChildren are able to create and illustrate their story, print it and have a finished work that looks very impressive. \\n  http://storybird.com/,\\n8,525,1,http://storybird.com/ is an awesome website that offers a forum for creative writing in the digital age. It is a medium that can aid students with their creative wirintg skills. The website offers an array of pictures, art works and drawings that can be sequenced to a student\\'s liking, and these pictures act as a promt for a story. This website is a great tool for students having trouble finding inspiration to write, or for the students who simply do not know where to begin and get overwhlemed by the possibilies of a blank screen. Every picture is unique and can be put into any order and given any meaning by the student, so the student is both guided and empowered at the same time. \\n  For the student who wishes to build a story around his or her own art, a similar website, http://storyjumper.com allows students to use original art and photographs to build stories online. \\n  Lastly, http://blabberize.com is a website that allows students to record their voices, and choose a character or animal or avatar to \"speak\" on their behalf. This woudl really benefit the student who fears reading aloud their creative writing to the class, because it can be really intimidating for some students and we need to be mindful of that. \\n  All of these websites can really be used across the board in all grade levels, and adapated according to content level. \\n  Michelle,\\n8,526,1,ahh! haha didn\\'t even see you posted this too :) ,\\n8,529,3,This isn\\'t so much an endorsement as it is a heads up that Audacity is considered the staple for audio editing purposes for pretty much any multimedia project. It ranks up there in its \"standardness\" level along with the likes of MS Word, Prezi, and SMARTboard, and it\\'s quite powerful for freeware. Three out of four schools I\\'ve visited last year have Audacity on all their computers, but only at one of them have I met a teacher who knew how to use its features thoroughly.\\n    Its interface isn\\'t designed for educational purposes, so making effective use of this program would require a good 20-minute chunk of classtime to teach the technicals. However, it goes a long way as a valuable skill that students can use to enhance any multimedia project throughout their years at school. It may even give some students an appreciation for the kind of studio work involved in music editing as they think about their favourite songs that more often than not use audio engineering or special effects.\\n  Earlier this year I got to witness a grade 8 English class at a Toronto girls school learn how to use Audacity for a narrated storytelling project, and I got to teach a mini-lesson on equalization, filtering, and pitch control. The students loved it, and I heard some of them say they wanted to use some of the techniques in their other courses.\\n  Some of the features are intuitive (like cutting, editing, trimming), whereas others (equalization, distortion) are more technical but be very useful in certain occasions.

I could not find a free streaming version of the documentary F.A.T. (Frustration. Anxiety. Tension) City by Rick Lavoie. His original video was from the 80\\'s, however his thinking about learning differences is still ahead of the curve. \\n  Despite the fact that the heart attack reference was a bit extreme, I think there is a valid reason he used it. You may not immediately kill a student, but slowly, the inequities in classrooms add up, leaving many kids depressed or anti-learning. This may not kill them, but it will make their learning differences turn into handicaps and limit their futures. As teachers, it\\'s really important to us to show students that their limits can, with appropriate knowledge, tools, coping mechanisms or oppourtunities, be overcome. If children don\\'t believe that, we effectively kill their spirit of hope and optimism. As such, it is a kind of death. \\n  Some point soon, I will purchase the DVD (and many newer releases Rick has put out) through Parentbooks where it is available, and I hope you will order it through the school board library, when you are all out there in the teaching field. :) (WE WILL GET A JOB....meditation mantra :P).\\n  In the mean time, please check out these resources:\\n  http://susanwquinn.wikispaces.com/fatcity\\n  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL86BCBE9D53BDA766,\\n8,545,1,Just bringing to the broader MT community a thread from my \"CTL7016: Integrating Technology into the Classroom\" course, posting anything I come across and find innovative and tech-related, or just nifty.

At the end of the unit though, it was clear that all the girls developed the confidence to get past the stereotype and even become proficient in basic programming skill and the thought-processes involved.

In it, Carl James says that the shooting of Jordon Manners made the public want to advocate a change. But as time passed, everything went back to normal. This chain of events is very similar to the Coloraldo shooting that occured two and a half months ago. When it first happened, CNN was covering it 24/7 along with other major news stations. There was discussion of stricter gun laws and  ways to prevent a catastrophic event like this from happening again. Since the shooting, nothing has changed and the media coverage has shifted to current and relavent topics.\\n  The example of Jordon Manner is just one of many examples of how society and media plays a huge role in public perception and reaction. The initial reactions to these events are quite strong but slowly resides when other things happen throughout the world. Since nothing is done, the chances of another shooting happening is almost certain. This is a sad problem and something needs to be done other than just public outrage and quick media coverage\\n  I\\'ve attached an article from \"the onion\" a satirical website that deals with the news.

Please explain your reactions and thoughts from 2007 after the murder of Jordan Manners. Have they changed much since then? \\n  2. “If the benefits of the role model and mentor are to be maximized, then those who present themselves as such need to actively and consistently engage, if not personify, an intentional critique of gender and gender construction, offer clarity around issues of gender identity and performance and make every effort not to re-inscribe the patriarchal ethos of masculinity performance.” (p 105)\\n  a.     What is required of an effective role model?\\nb.    Can female and male teachers serve as effective role models to both boys and girls, or does sex matter?\\n  3.

Is a person’s future determined by individual effort in spite of class, race, gender and citizenship? (Can we really hold on to the Canadian/American dream?

Thanks for bringing up these points and lending your geography background. It has me thinking about the years I lived in Moss Park during undergrad and now, my experiences in Cabbagetown which is just north of Regent Park. \\n  Last year, in the midst of all the Regent Park redevelopments, I realized that the first grocery store in Regent Park had just opened, quite literally down the street from my house.  While I had spent years living beside Regent, I was so oblivious to the fact that the neighbourhood actually didn\\'t have a great deal of resources within it, like grocery stores, that could drastically improve the quality of life for residents. While there were grocery stores relatively close, I realized when the new store opened that residents were likely challenged by the lack of resources close by.  Within weeks of the store opening it was interesting to see families flocking to the store on Sundays, or parents who were shift workers buying their groceries at all hours of the night.  I admit, I had totally taken this basic access to food completely for granted because I was able to pick up groceries on the way home from school at Ryerson, or hop on the TTC to make my trek home with bags that much easier.   I appreciated reading Poverty by Postal Code and other reports that come from a similar vein, because I gained a lot more perspective on the lived experiences in the neighbourhoods where I used to live or live close by to.  I don\\'t want to be too idealistic about the Regent Park redevelopments because I do have concerns about things I have seen or heard, but I do think that access is a step in the right direction.   For example, right beside the grocery store is now a 24 hour Tim Hortons. It is packed! Though it may seem small, having a 24 hour coffee shop has really made that one corner a social spot for older individuals in the community, families and teenagers. And, from what I\\'ve seen from studying in there or grabbing coffees with my friends, it is a really positive space! \\n  Anyway, I\\'m risking rambling right now, but I though I\\'d just add in my two cents based on my personal experiences.,\\n8,571,3,Hi Everyone, \\n  Mark Simms and Paul Nguyen are two residents of Jane and Finch that cofounded the popular website www.jane-finch.com.

The fact that the reputation of certain areas, in this case Jane and Finch, are perpetuated by their negative representation in the media, and are in fact not truly representative of the population living in those areas.  For example, the two community members in this video mentioned that they were shocked that there was a shooting at C.W. Jeffries, a really good school, whereas the media simply wrote it off as being linked to the area in which the school is located.\\n  Looking forward to class discussions this week.,\\n8,578,1,Chapter 6 concludes Life at the Intersection with stories of two men, Kulsoom and Sam, who both grew up in the Jane and Finch area. Their stories touch on the relationship between family background and school life, as well as the impact that living in the Jane and Finch community had on their world views.\\n  Thoughts for discussion:\\n  It is evident that communities play a critical role in the lives of our students. Social class, background, ethnicity, culture - all of these aspects of our students\\' lives are embedded in the community they live and ultimately have an effect on their school life. Systemically, low socio-economic schools are marginalized, underfunded, and unsupported in a school system that is dominated by a \"middle-class Eurocentric ethos of society.\" \\nHow can teachers help our students recognize the importance of education and help them succeed in an environment (society) that doesn\\'t seem to support them?\\nHow can teachers make the most of limited resources to make curriculum and learning meaningful and relevant? What are the challenges that we may face and who will pose these challenges?\\n   ,\\n8,579,1,Shannon! Ben!!\\n  I want in on these research meetings. Apparently \"we\" are meeting Thursday at lunch? How did the last meeting go?\\n  Ps. Ben is kind of \"the shit\" - incase anyone reads this post. Amazing research.\\n  I\\'m so enthusiastic about this trifecta of awesomeness - other people need to get in on this. Can\\'t wait for Thursday.\\n  Cheers,\\n  Alexia\\n   ,\\n8,580,2,Totally wished I knew about this last week ><\\n  *paid $16*\\n  -Cak,\\n8,581,1,It is great that we are seeing people come out to speak about these issues: in the book we read for class \"life at the intersection\", and most importantly to the media, which is the perpetuator of such negative stereotypes.  It really shines a light on the media itself as a propoganda machine, even here in home Canada.  Most people will listen to the news and take everything as unaltered fact, unbiased, and objective, which it is for the most part, as far as I know, or maybe im just one of those people :P.  The only thing is that they may choose to overgeneralize or overemphasize certain points, and leave some out for \"the good of the citizens\".  Jane-Finch is a scapegoat, I have come to realize, in the truest sense.  It seems like it is there to put clearly defined boarders around violence within our city, even though violence is taking place everywhere.  It is there to make people who do not live there feel safe in their own neighbourhoods, at the cost of the people whom the media are \"black listing\" by association to their geographical location.\\n  There must be at least some truth in stereotypes, why else would they exist if it was not so?  However, the problem is when these ideas get generalized and overextended by the power of the masses.  This is what has happened to the Jane-Finch neighbourhood.  By people speaking out and having their voices heard, it is the only way for this stereotype, which has been prolonged by many years of stoking, to be exposed for what it really is.  The question is whether or not \"the man\" will allow this to happen.,\\n8,582,1,I too would like to thank you for that video Alex!\\n  And in response to Andrea, I think the topic of how the media portrays certain communities, such as the Jane and Finch area, can be extremely negative and have a huge impact on these communities.  Growing up I went to high school with many students who lived at or near Jane and Finch and their personal opinions of their neighbourhood were always very different from what it was we were reading about and being \"told\" essentially.  I think that because we see only the surface of the community, and tend to jump to conclusions based on what I would call a biased interpretation in some cases, we can \\'accidentally\\' become ignorant and unaware.  Just like it discusses in this weeks readings, \"Life at the Intersection\" many of the residence at Jane and Finch find their surroundings comfortable, safe, have a sense of community, and enjoy living there.  I am very much looking forward to this weeks class discussions so that we can further unpack this book as well as the stereotypes that exist.\\n  As well, in response to Lucas I think that it is so important for us to realize that there is indeed violence everywhere.  It is all a matter of what becomes the top media story, and how it is portrayed.  I am again, very much looking forward to discussing all of these topics in class.\\n  Here is my final thought, I am sure we are all interested in helping to speak out and have our voices heard, as Lucas has mentioned, and besides bypassing, for lack of a better word, the pressure of the \"man\" how could we as a community go about discussing such issues on a level that will create a positive impact?  Is this at all possible?,\\n8,583,1,I just wanted to say thank you again to those who told their stories last class.  I have been thinking about them all week and have really been reevaluating who I see myself as.  The impact of story telling is quite remarkable and has proven, in past experiences, that it is a fantastic way to connect with one another, build a community, and evoke questions in ourselves.\\n  Before last weeks class, I think I would have shared a very different story than I will when the time comes for me to share.\\n  I think that not only will this be a great experience in our class, but that we should transfer this idea into our own classrooms with our students.\\n  Thank you again Aaron, Jean, and Zack!,\\n8,585,3,Taken from the readings.

As per this morning\\'s discussion, here\\'s an editable note that only the 28 of us can view. If you have suggestions on how best we could make our cohort a safe, inclusive space, post them here! And then hopefully we can sort out the timing in an expedient, but not rushed, manner. - Laura\\n  I would suggest that we start planning it now so we can hopefully do something before practicum. Do we need an external facilitator, and if so, do we have suggestions?\\n  If we are going to do something like this we should probably agree on ground rules. The following are only a suggestion, feel free to modify, add, or delete as you see fit (-Zack):\\n1) Participation is voluntary: we encourage everyone in the class to participate and acknowledge that each one of us contributes to a caring community. That being said, decision to participate is personal and no one should feel coerced to participate.\\n2) We acknowledge that our classroom environment is currently not safe for everyone and want to take concrete steps to remedy the situation.\\n3) We agree to speak honestly and respectfully, and acknowledge that others\\' personal experience/perspective may be different from our own.\\n4) We agree to listen attentively and without judgement as others are sharing their perspectives. We agree to only talk during our turn.\\n  Hi all!  It\\'s Heather... Just wanted to follow up because last I checked this was still a go. Laura, thanks for starting this thread. Zack, thanks for contributing.\\n  I agree that whatever we do has to be facilitated with a purpose and with ground rules, boundaries...whatever you want to call it. I think it is important that everyone is heard, but everyone also knows what our goal is in the end so that we can all keep it in mind while we share and discuss. I can only speak for myself and for me it comes down to what I\\'ve said through SALT before... I\\'d love to see us create a caring, connected and empowered community in our class.  \\n  I agree that people should not be peer pressured to do anything, including be in attendance, but I have to say that I don\\'t think the process will work and any real progress will be made on a collective front if people are missing. Everyone is important to our community.\\nI disagree regarding the suggestion that not everyone has to participate, but maybe that is because I see participation in much the same way as Wesley. Participation can simply be listening and being a positive presence in the room or exercising your right to pass after hearing others out.  I think it is essential that everyone in our class is present for the discussions because we do spend a large period of time together and in many senses we operate as a cohort. If people are not present and someone wishes to speak to them or share an idea with them I believe our peace building session may be stalled.\\n[Zack] I moderated the phrasing to reflect your input.\\n  I get that last minute issues and emergencies come up of course and that this exercise would ask us all to carve out a few more hours of our busy schedules, but I would like to suggest that we all try to be present, if not to share our thoughts, but to listen to that of others. Also, participating in a peace building activity could be one of the greatest lessons we learn while at OISE.\\n  Anyway, when would people be interested in doing it? Next Thursday morning? The following Thursday morning? Following Laura\\'s thoughts, I think we should consider doing this before practicum.\\n[Zack] Thursday mornings would not work for me and probably for several others. I suggest an afternoon. Also, Judy is teaching a class on Thursday morning if we choose to ask her to facilitate.\\n  What do people think about approaching someone at OISE to facilitate this process like Jackie or Judy? I mention them because they are tribes trainers.\\nYes? No?  (How do I ask these questions without us going around in circles, haha?)\\n  [Zack] I doubt that they will agree to do it for free. We are talking about a significant time commitment. That being said, if we split the cost, it should not be more than a few dollars per person.\\n  Would people prefer someone external come in? St.Stephen\\'s Community House in Toronto offers free conflict mediation and alternative dispute resolution services.  http://www.ststephenshouse.com/crs.shtml\\n(*they also offer courses and PD in it) \\n[Zack] Sounds good to me.\\n  I\\'m happy to reach out to anyone we select, would just love feedback from as many of you as possible. Let\\'s keep the dialogue going! :)\\n  Heather\\n  I\\'ll primarily watch, listen, nod, and absorb. Although I don\\'t doubt that St. Stephen\\'s Community House has expertise to offer, I personally feel it would be smoother and \"real\" just keeping it J/I Y2, with the exception of Judy. For some of us she\\'s almost become a motherly figure and I would really enjoy having her with us. Of course that may not fly with all of you, but I\\'m just throwing it out there and at the end of the day I\\'ll be okay with any arrangement you decide, really.\\n  -Cak\\n  (The below is a vent, and is not conducive to our discussion of strategies and next-steps, I chose not to delete it, because I don\\'t think exercising that power would be supportive for those who have read it and have been burdened by it.  Please, understand it is a vent if you choose to read below)\\nIt\\'s been a year of damage, of talking, of ignoring and perpetuating the idea that we were \\'fine\\'.  I do believe it needs to be talked about, and I would much prefer someone who knows us already, to save time (preferably Judy.), I might also be cynical in that this could be an incredibly long process (multiple sessions) and that some of us may not be wanting/willing/committed to put in this time and effort for what amounts to 6 more months of possibly being together.  Yes, arguably the process of conflict resolution and community re-building would be beneficial, but from a logisitics stand, putting 28 people through group-therapy (which is essentially what we\\'re doing) is, from my own profesisonal background, a giant task, especially when many of us may not have done such processes, or are aware of the processes that go on in group faciliation/planning.  It might be too large of a task too late, of which more damage may come from forcing it. (-Tori, if you\\'re interested in what \\'group processes\\' mean from a counselling lens, poke me :) )\\nOne suggesiton I have, could we come together as a group, to maybe create a code of ethics, or guidelines that we would like to hold eachother, and ourselves to? Community guidelines that we can individually put forward, but also collectively agree on? That way if an issue comes up, between persons in the class it can be discussed under that framework? Just a thought. -Tori\\n  Hey friends,\\nI think it\\'s time that we bring Judy into our peacebuilding. I have a lot to say, but I\\'d love to speak in person. Speak soon.\\n  Lorne\\n  Hey all!

I did not follow the event closely in the news, but my general perception had been that the shooting was gang related and that jordan was mistakenly identified as someone else by gang members. Now when I reread in more details about the story I realise that we might never know the real reason for the murder. The accused boys, who  pleaded not guilty, have been acquited since. I wonder how much of the general media coverage of Jane and Finch as a gang-infested neigbourhood had contributed to this false perception I had had. \\n  2. I believe that what a teacher does counts a lot more then either their gender or their race. That being said, I can see how some teenage males might benefit from a male mentor. I am not sure teachers should assume this role though. I think a big-brother type of mentor, who is closer to the students\\' age and does not need to grade the students at the end of the term can be more effective.\\n  3. First, I think we need to see the student as an individual and not as \"Jane and Finch\" student. I liked what Jean said - as much as possible, try to create a mental clean slate in your mind. Second, we need to treat students with respect, even if at first we might not feel respected by them. Respecting students is more than just being polite to them - it includes respecting them as a learner. If our lesson plans do not enable the students to access the curriculum, students feel disrespected. I would like to believe that when teachers make an effort to reach out to the students, students notice. \\n\\n4. I cannot really say. Years will tell whether the concept works for students.

I also have the beginnings of my Methodology in this doc.\\n  Thanks,\\n8,617,3,It is comforting to know that some individuals like Marc Prensky recognize the cultural disconnect between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants at a level of specificity beyond the almost amorphous imperative, “In the 21st Century, we have to integrate technology in a way that is meaningful and relevant to students!” Too often have I watched professional development sessions or heard teacher candidates advocate admirable goals like digital citizenry or technological literacy but neglect to describe what such objectives look and feel like. No one even mentions how we get there. “I think we as teachers need to ensure that we don’t use technology purely for the sake of using technology” is now common parlance. It’s about time we dug deeper and figured out what that actually means.\\n  I appreciate Prensky’s diverse anecdotes of Digital Immigrant “accents” (my personal favourite is illustrated by the following xkcd comic). They are subtle reminders that in addition to overarching ideologies, the “little things in life” matter too. Even in 2001 when this paper was written, he already seems to have a clear idea of just what is lacking in the overlap between TK, PK and CK of the TPACK framework that professors Koehler & Mishra published five years later. Unfortunately, with all his pointing out what Digital Immigrants are doing wrong, Prensky isn’t as diligent in proposing a concrete plan to fix it. A particularly critical reader may even be insulted by his concluding remark, “if Digital Immigrant educators really want to reach Digital Natives—i.e. all their students—they will have to change” and almost condescending Nike reference, “Just do it!”\\n    As long as there are professionals who are well-versed in the nuances and functions—the “little things that matter”—of various technologies, there is little reason why they cannot facilitate professional development among colleagues in the same way it has long taken place in other pedagogical areas. Educational libraries are chock-full of resources or literature providing lists of step-by-step teaching strategies for classrooms of different sizes and for specific scenarios, with detailed rationales for those strategies. Such resources describe their merits, disadvantages, and alternative measures, and often minimize reference to underlying theoretical framework. In the technological world, the equivalent would be a video game walkthrough. Yet it is a wonder that no reliable “walkthrough” has emerged among the education community. And it is a wonder that despite Prensky taking the time to highlight all the inadequacies of the stereotypical Digital Immigrant capped with his “Just do it” manifesto, a gaping hole still stands between current widespread demand for classroom technology, and currently existing archives of ready-to-download SMART Board templates. That hole is a void of overwhelming helplessness where educators don’t know what they don’t know, and only the likes of Prensky can facilitate the first step of revealing that to them.\\n  In other words, Digital Immigrants need to be shown the way across that hole (though not necessarily led by the hand). For me, that means taking a bottom-up approach and literally teaching what our tools are capable of doing before we pretend to know how they fit in an educational context. While technology pervasiveness has been approaching monumental proportions since the 1990s, we need to bear in mind that bare bones technology is not at all intuitive. Try explaining to a Digital Immigrant the difference between embedding a .wmv[1] into a PowerPoint document and embedding a YouTube video into an html document, as was recently asked of me, and it will become clear that the seemingly “little things” (like incompatible multimedia file formats) can insidiously derail an entire lesson and forever discourage future attempts to use digital media. Only when we all have some common ground in basic technological function (just as one should expect any capable math teacher to know basic arithmetic) can one be ready to discuss fruitfully about what sets outstanding hardware and software apart from the duds. â– \\n\\n[1] Without installing third-party codecs, the .wmv video format is only playable on proprietary software developed by Microsoft. While a teacher education program is probably not the place to address such technicality, it is worth mentioning an incident at one of my practicum blocks whereby a teacher allegedly gave up showing YouTube videos altogether “because” the school’s computers didn’t support the video her son extracted for her from a DVD at home. It is also worth mentioning that it didn’t matter to the teacher that YouTube had absolutely nothing to do with her son’s extraction in the first place!\\n  -Cak,\\n8,618,1,Hello Professor Crichlow,\\n  If we have a makeup class on the 11th.

Thank you.\\n  Shael,\\n8,619,1,,\\n8,620,1,Don\\'t understand what your kids are saying? \\n  http://www.urbandictionary.com \\n  Boom!,\\n8,621,1,   Reading Prensky’s article begs the question: Just who ARE these supposed digital natives? Written in the USA in 2001, referring to students in k-onwards, it is predicated on a number of assumptions: Access to television, video games, and the internet.  What of those who have limited access due to family choices, or raised outside of the US (or Canada) in less privileged environments?  While Prensky was clearly frustrated by teachers who completely and unilaterally rejected use of any technology, which likely came from a place of experience and frustration, his underlying suggestion that places individuals into camps irrespective of their socio-economic status, place of birth, and access to resources warrants major scrutiny.  The loaded terminology of ‘immigrant’ and ‘native’ implies a differential that catches a number of nuances not sufficiently explored in this article.\\n   I expect there are as few Canadians who could claim truly ‘native’ status in the realm of the digital as in the realm of the political.  Likewise, whether that heritage truly equips you to explore your birthright is as equally problematic.  Even for “immigrants” we recognize all of the variables predicated on socio-economic class.  The question for me is “just what are those variables for the ‘digital’ realm”?  Similarly, are there are downfalls to being born into this area?  Despite Presnky’s definition which places me at the edge of the supposed “native” generation, my students have had a completely different experience of technology.  While I do not see a fundamental divide in how we interact with the use of technology for specific end goals, the difference is less in our ability to leverage technology productively, and more in the presence of absence of a lens which also assesses technology as a possible hindrance which deserves to be put aside in search of increased concentration or appropriate human interaction.  Is that a skill which needs nurturing?\\nMy perception is coloured by many exchanges over the years with my “digital immigrant” former roommate and his wife, a professor and a law librarian respectively, who constantly share their frustration with a generation they consider digital “natives” and yet are completely unaware of how even to leverage the full power available in a Google search, corroborated by own experiences in a grade 4 and 8 classroom.  As native, you don’t always know what you don’t know.\\n   The question of “flow” must also be posed.  Was Monkey Wrench engaging because it was a “game,” or because the medium allowed it to differentiate itself to meet the zone of proximal development?  Is it truly the medium of instruction, or an intermediary quality which one medium tends to be better equipped to access than another? There is also the question of human to human interaction, as opposed to human to machine or human to human mediated by machine which was not explored and which makes me profoundly uneasy to completely eliminate in the name of “catering” to natives’ learning styles.\\n   My background in ergonomics also raises strong concerns regarding the unmitigated enthusiasm for long term, regular technology use.  Finally, we are all “digital” natives, equipped with amazing dexterity to alter the world to our needs and liking.  Even scissor use is a valid outcome of kindergarten, acknowledging that some potentials of our bodies are realized more fully by some than others, and most of it has to do with actually exposure and practice, which in turn an educational system and teacher can potentially help to increase.  That holds as true in the realm of digital data as in true “digital” manipulation.  My concern of placing individuals in some arbitrary camp is that it fails to consider and support the multitude of factors which could lead to true mastery, or to consider the negative consequences to technology use which need to be counteracted. I intend to explore a variety of tools in my classrooms, where “tools” are those objects capable of increasing learning.  However, that has been an active process requiring active investment in learning technologies which had no inherent interest to me, and constantly researching and experimenting with tools during my personal time.  It is not a simple process and it is an unending one.  Prensky’s “Just Do It!” is scathing rather than supportive and fails to acknowledge the time and energy drain which keeping abreast of changing tools can require.  A methodology for addressing that issue from a systems perspective rather than as an individual imperative would have been more appropriate and likely more fruitful.,\\n8,622,1,Hi all,\\n  Here is the intro and the first chapter for the School to Prison Pipeline reading.

I was either watching TV, playing videogames, or chatting with my friends online. Digital technology has always been a big part of my life. I had a strong affinity to it. In fact, within a year of my family getting our first computer, I had my own website up and running. The following year, the website served as an online portfolio for all my art work, including pieces I had produced in Adobe Photoshop. By the time I was in Grade 10, I knew html and practiced coding web pages from scratch using Microsoft Frontpage. I even memorized some of my favourite colour codes for html! To me, it is obvious that my understanding of digital technology is very different from that of older generations. I recognized this dichotomy back in high school when I was teaching my art/media literacy teacher how to use various Adobe software (Illustrator and Photoshop) as she tried to incorporate them into her program.\\n  Reading through the Prensky article made me think about whether or not I am a Digital Native. I believe I am a Digital Native, but not because of my skill with a few software programs. Being a digital native does not require one to be particularly proficient with digital technology. I am much more comfortable with computers and smart phones than many middle school students whom I taught in previous placements, but that does not make them any less a digital native than I am. Being a digital native is all about a different kind of thinking. Digital natives thinking one way while digital immigrants think another. A digital immigrant’s accent can be seen despite their level of proficiency with a given technology. For example, one of my ATs was very good with using her Smartboard. She knew all the tools and features in SMART Notebook, but did not ever go past using it as an overpriced power point display, or a nifty white board. When I used the smartboard to teach my lessons, she commented that she never thought to use it in the ways that I did. She even asked to keep my Notebook files for later uses. So being a digital native is not about what you do, but how you think. Moreover, while digital immigrants like my AT can learn new strategies, techniques and tools that will work for her students, a digital native will be able to create them and really cater them to the needs of their students.\\n  As a teacher who is a digital native, I am able to think like my students and understand what will work and what won’t. Including digital technology in my programs will be a natural and logical by-product of my ideas and thought processes. For example, Prensky talks about how to use calculators and computers to teach the multiplication table. I can’t imagine teaching it without using digital technology. Sitting down and memorizing the multiplication table goes against my way of thinking and thus my instinctive approach to how I would teach it. Rote memorization does not have immediate gratification or frequent rewards, unless it’s put into some kind of memory game. Such a game could incorporate a point system and achievements to be unlocked as the player progresses. This might not be the best idea, but it is the first thing that came to mind when I thought of how to teach the multiplication table. A quick search in the Apple App Store reveals many games (Time Tables Warp, Time Table Lite, Times Tables, and many more) designed to help students learn multiplication tables in just the way I described. In the end, my hope is not to be able to include digital technology into my program, because I know that will happen, but to design curricula in a way that not only engages my students, but also motivates them to succeed.\\n     ,\\n8,626,2,              When I first started reading Marc Prensky’s article, “Digital Native, Digital Immigrants,” my first response was to identify myself as a digital native. My family got our first computer when I was in grade three, and shortly after that I began using the Internet. From that point on, the Internet was always my primary source for finding information. It is now my primary source for mostly everything that I do. I don’t buy CDs; I download music. I don’t develop film; I upload photos from my phone. Not only do I receive things instantly, but I am accustomed to instantly sharing what I am doing with family an friends on social network sites. At first thought, I identified myself as a digital native.\\n            As I continued to read the Prensky article, I began to identify hints of a “digital immigrant” accent within myself. This accent, however, is not as thick as my parents’ accent. I don’t read manuals before I attempt to use a program, and I am constantly trying to help my mother understand that computer programs will teach themselves. There are times, however, when I realize that I am more of a digital immigrant than my brother or other young people. For example, my first thought when Blockbuster closed down was “How will I ever rent movies again?” and I was surprised when people told me that they had been downloading movies for years. I was also frustrated when I learned in my publishing class that Indigo was converting the majority of its store to gift product, because books were going to be downloaded. For a true digital native, this probably wouldn’t be such terrible news. For the children of today, who are already reading books on ipads, it won’t matter at all.\\n            When I have a classroom, I feel that I will be able to teach digital natives. I have been surrounded by technology and I have used technology enough so that I am not afraid of it, which is an issue that can occur with many digital immigrants. I know that technology is changing and evolving, and as I see it evolve faster and faster throughout the years I can understand and accept the fact that it is a way of life that must be adopted into the classroom. I am excited to incorporate it into all areas of my teaching.\\n            As somebody who “Googles” every question that pops into her head at any given time, I can understand that students are able to receive any information that they want faster than we can explain it to them. It is not our job as teachers to pass on facts to our student. This may change the pedagogy of some teachers who have been teaching for a long time. Since student can already find information, I will probably spend more time teaching students how to critically evaluate and analyze the information that they receive. I will also teach them to look at a variety of sources to find their information, rather than just the textbooks, and I will use technology to help them discover concepts through inquiry.\\n            For now, I think that my experience with technology will allow me to teach digital natives in ways that suit them. As technology changes and evolves, however, I am afraid that I will become further behind and eventually the students will catch up and possibly surpass my knowledge of technology. Some of them already have.\\n            My goal for myself as a teacher is to stay current with technology and also with teaching pedagogy. In a few years, many of the things that I am doing with technology in my classroom will be irrelevant or boring. I want to keep up with the changing times so that my teaching practices and use of technology is relevant for all of the students in my classroom – even the ones many years from now. ,\\n8,628,1,http://kasamaproject.org/2012/02/21/the-school-to-prison-pipeline-zero-tolerance-and-the-criminalization-of-youth/,\\n8,629,1,  Summary\\n\\nThe Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) is an arm’s-length Crown agency.

The Fraser Institute uses the publicly available information to create the “School Report Card” website. http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/ChooseReport.aspx\\nETFO voices a strong position against EQAO. Some of their main points:\\nIt has lead to overemphasis of math and literacy in schools to the detriment of all other subjects (science, social studies, arts, etc.)\\nIt creates too much pressure on students, teachers, and administrators.\\nTeachers’ assessments are the most valid and reliable\\nIt is a waste of time and money that could be used more productively.\\nETFO has issued two advisories regarding EQAO; one informs teachers that the EQAO teacher questionnaire is voluntary, and urges teachers not to answer it; the other urges teachers to avoid taking jobs as markers of EQAO tests, as these tests are an “attack on the teaching profession”. NOTE: If members do not heed the advice provided by an advisory, they will not be subject to discipline.\\nTeachers and principals are responsible for ensuring the fair and consistent administration of the assessments as outlined in the Administration Guide. Sample details in the administration guide include:\\n\\nThe test is divided into 6 sections. Each section is one hour long with optional extension that must directly follow the allotted hour.\\nFor reading sections, teachers may not read the passages or the questions for the students.\\nFor other sections, teacher may only read the questions to students who request it, but must not translate, interpret, explain, suggest, or influence the student’s decisions in any way (e.g. drawing the student’s attention to an unanswered question).\\nAll classroom materials containing reading, writing or mathematics content of an instructional nature must be removed from view or covered.\\nAny circumstances that may affect the scoring of student work (e.g., package ID number issues) or may have affected the validity of any student performance (e.g., a discussion between two students during the assessment) must be documented and reported to EQAO on the Issues Envelope.\\nAccommodations are allowed only for students with IEP, except for special circumstances (e.g., the student is new to the school) and with the principal\\'s approval. In any case, accommodations must be arranged in advance. Only accommodations listed in the accommodations guide are allowed. Accommodation categories are: setting (e.g., quiet space, prompter), time (e.g. supervised breaks), presentation format (e.g. assistive technology), and response format (e.g. scribing).\\nELL students who do not have an IEP are not eligible for accommodations, but are eligible for special provisions (e.g., quiet room, extra time)\\nTeachers and administrators who do not follow the EQAO guidelines risk being charged with professional misconduct. \\nhttp://professionallyspeaking.oct.ca/march_2007/go_hearings.asp\\nhttp://professionallyspeaking.oct.ca/september_2009/go_investigations.asp\\nSome such cases have received media attention: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/story/2010/09/21/ontario-schools-standardized-testing-eqao.html\\n\\nReferences\\nLaws:\\nEducation Act, RSO 1990, c E.2, <http://canlii.ca/t/51whp> retrieved on 2012-10-07\\nOperation Of Schools - General, RRO 1990, Reg 298, <http://canlii.ca/t/kwq8> retrieved on 2012-10-07\\nProvincial Interest In Education, O Reg 43/10, <http://canlii.ca/t/kqt9> retrieved on 2012-10-07\\nEducation Quality and Accountability Office Act, 1996, SO 1996, c 11, <http://canlii.ca/t/1jtr> retrieved on 2012-10-07\\n\\nGuides, magazines, and other publications:\\nEducation Quality and Accountability Office (2012).

I grew up in a house that was very computer-friendly – we had computers in the house very early – and I was able to play on them in my spare time and learn how to use them by trial-and-error. I rarely read instruction manuals nor did I use help menus, but rather I discovered computer programs on my own and used online help forums to boost my learning when needed. My intrinsic drive to become computer literate stemmed both from the desire to access higher and more complex technologies, and from the idea that discovery learning was the primary way – maybe even the only way – that people learned how to use new things. Because I was exposed to this method of learning early on and because of this way of thinking, I hypothesize that my brain has developed along similar lines of digital natives. I show signs of this in my “accent”. For example, I still feel a tendency to want to read documents in hard copy if I am reading a document for school, reading a book, or editing work.\\n  I agree with Prensky that ideally, we would adapt all of our teaching to this new learning style. I especially appreciated Prensky’s mention of the “instantaneity” that “Digital Natives” are accustomed to in their everyday lives. I have thought for some time that it is unreasonable to ask students who are immersed in a culture of instant gratification to sit in a chair at school for 8 hours and learn in a way that is completely foreign (and boring) to them. However, I have to ask myself one burning question: is there a support system – resources, workshops, etc – for teachers who are willing and ready to do this in a realistic way? I stress the term realistic here because we have to remember that we work not only under time constraints but also a limited budget and limited school resources. I have little doubt that in an ideal world, teachers would be able and willing to cater to the “Digital Native” minds of their students, but it isn’t as simple as educating the next generation of teachers and sending them off into the world. Policies, structures, teaching norms exist, and we as future teachers are always combating against falling back into patterns of teaching that our own teachers used.\\n  However, just because it is difficult to cater to these students, that doesn’t mean that we can’t. As pessimistic as this reflection may be, I look forward to being a part of the slow change towards discovery learning. I believe that the most realisitic way to enact this change will be to incoporate “critical thinking” principles in my teaching practice, which I have begun doing and plan to do in the future.\\n   ,\\n8,641,1,Hi everyone,\\n  just wanted to let you know that there will be class tomorrow at 9. Those who are facilitating the next readings will stick to doing it on Monday. \\n  See you tomorrow,\\n8,642,1,  My first step upon learning that we had to read an article and respond to it was to print Prensky. I chuckled to myself as he explains having to print your e-mail or print a document in order to edit it as indicators, or as the “accent” of a ‘digital immigrant.’ Also amusing was watching my classmate start his assignment. He pulled the article up on line and was making all of his notes and comments in to the article with a digital tech format. Clearly a more efficient way of organizing his thoughts, but one that I would never think of, or know how to do.\\n            Prensky defines a ‘digital native’ as those students k-12 who’ve spent their entire lives surrounded by all the toys and tools of the digital age. Growing up my family did not have cable, I hardly ever used our computer, and I didn’t have a cell phone until University. This was not due to economic realities, but a value judgment made by my parents and a total lack of interest and curiosity on my part. I always acknowledged that using digital tech was not my strength, but I didn’t see this as a disadvantage until I began the MT program.   \\n            I agree with Prensky’s argument that the arrival and rapid dissemination of digital tech has fundamentally changed things. He argues that as a result of the sheer volume of digital tech, and students interaction with it today’s students think and process information fundamentally differently; and because different kinds of experiences lead to different brain structures their brains may actually be physically different. Therefore it is imperative that the nature of education changes as well. I understand this means that I must teach in a way that is responsive to these students, by for example, teaching faster and less step-by-step. Although there are resources that explain how to implement specific pedagogical strategies, like the ‘writers workshop,’ there seems to be less detailed strategies for integrating technology. In order for a ‘digital immigrant,’ like myself, to incorporate technology I need to learn how in the way I learn best, slowly and methodically. For someone who has difficulty exploring new digital technologies, there should be resources to help guide this process.  \\n            I am not sure I buy Prensky’s argument that digital tech is the best way to teach all subject matter. He says he prefers teaching ‘digital natives’ through video games because it’s a means that most of them are totally familiar. He explains that Monkey wrench, a videogame designed to help engineers learn CAD software has been extremely successful, but his audience was almost exclusively male engineers between 20-30 years old. We don’t know if this technique would have been as successful with a different demographic, for example, a group of female historians.\\n            In his “thought experiments” he invites professors and teachers to give him a subject or topic and he’ll invent a game or other ‘digital native’ method for teaching it. In response to “classical philosophy” he suggested a game in which philosophers debate and the learners have to pick out what each would say. This is fine, but this could only be done at the end of the learning. In response to the “holocaust” as a topic, he suggested creating a simulation where students role-play the meeting at Wannsee, but I don’t see why an old-fashioned role-play couldn’t be as effective. He also says that digital immigrants think learning can’t be fun, I think this assumption is incorrect and I do not think that digital technology necessarily makes learning ‘fun,’ or even more engaging.\\n            It occurs to me that in my response and problems with Prensky I am just showing my reluctance to integrating technology, despite the fact that I acknowledge its importance. Although I cringe when I see an eight year old with an iPhone, because I am teaching a new generation I need to be what Prensky calls a ‘smart immigrant,’ one that accepts that they don’t know about their new world and take advantage of their kids to help them learn and integrate. And although I would label myself a ‘digital immigrant,’ and still have no desire to get many new digital tech tools, including the infamous iPhone, there are clearly parts of digital tech culture that I have embraced and that I acknowledge make my life much easier. For example, I am currently writing this paper aboard an airplane on my laptop. I reluctantly admit that I must continue to challenge myself and take risks with digital technology before I become “out of date” in the eyes of my students and my employers. ,\\n8,644,1,Based on Prensky’s examples, I clearly identify as a digital native. I grew up with computer games since a very early age. I learnt much of my early English (as a native Hebrew speaker) through computer games. I started to learn some computer programming on my own at the age of 10. I studied computer engineering in university and worked in several hi-tech companies taking part in the development of new digital technologies, such as digital camera processors and multimedia mobile phones. Throughout my schooling and work I have preferred learning by random access and interactive trial and error, as opposed to slow , linear, step-by-step learning.\\n  As a teacher, I disagree Prensky’s generalization that all young people are fluent in digital language. Children vary significantly in the amount and nature of their use of digital technology. In fact, I find that most students, despite being prolific user of technology, are not very proficient with it. They  use it narrowly and superficially. For example, I have worked with students who did not understand basic concepts such as creating folders and moving file between computers, despite spending much of their leisure time watching youtube videos and posting on facebook. I think it is important to teach students the skills related to using technology productively. We cannot assume that they know these skills simply because they were born in the 21st century. \\n  I agree with Prensky that teachers need to go “faster, more random access, and less step-by-step”, although I am not sure it is a phenomena that is necessarily unique to the digital generation. Educational movements such as project based learning, inquiry based learning, experiential learning, which predate the digital age, have long argued that top-down, transmissive teaching was not effective for students. In my opinion, the main reasons for changing pedagogy is not that today’s learners are inherently different, but that technology provides us with the opportunity to provide meaningful and individualized learning experience on a massive scale.\\n\\nI do not see this opportunity in the same way as Prensky though. Gamification of school subject should not be the main focus. Education in the 21st century should include more than technological competencies. It should also help learners develop Habits of Mind (Costa, 2008), such as persistence, listening with empathy, managing impulsivity, metacognition, and thinking interdependently. Developing such habits will not happen in environments that emphasize immediate gratification such as most computer games. \\n\\nInstead, I believe we should focus on utilizing technology to develop learner driven, reflective, mastery oriented environments. Tools such as digital portfolios with a focus on process can encourage personalization of learning, reflection on learning, goal setting, and deliberate practice. Tools such as digital storytelling enable student to express themselves in richer ways a typical school writing assignment.\\n\\nDespite my disagreements with Prensky, I think his article has served as an important wake up call to educators. As a future teacher who is a proficient user and developer of digital technologies, I am excited to explore  the opportunities that access to digital technology presents to pedagogy.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nCosta, A.L. (2008). Describing the Habits of Mind. In A.L. Costa & B. Kallick (Eds.), Learning and Leading with habits of mind: 16 essential characteristics for success. Alexandria, VA:ASCD.\\n ,\\n8,647,7,  It is interesting to note how quickly a paper written on technology can go out of date, as oppose to any other field of study out there.  While Prensky was able to discern the differences between a Digital Native and Digital Immigrant, such differences do not appear to be as apparent as they may have been eleven years ago, at least among teachers.  As far as I have seen in both my practicum placements, teachers (who can be labeled as Digital Immigrants) seem to have completely lost their “accents” with time.  Such “accents” are artifacts of prior experience, which Digital Natives do not have.  Is this necessarily a bad thing though?  Teachers must always be staying current, and up to date in their practice, but does being a Digital Immigrant as oppose to a Digital Native have anything to do with it?\\n            Prensky seems to offer a general definition of Digital Natives as being those who have grown up with technology their whole lives (mostly “kids”), and Digital Immigrants as those who have been around before technology had become so mainstream, and had gotten into it later in their lives (mostly “older people”).  I think that these days, contrary to Prensky\\'s elaboration on the definitions, it is harder to differentiate between the two based on technological skills alone.  The only defining line could be age, and even that is hard to generalize, because many children these days could be considered Digital Immigrants as well, myself included. \\n            So, based on this concept, which could use some updating, it would be hard to place myself within one category because I was on the cusp of the digital revolution.  Perhaps I had not had a personal home computer or internet access until I was roughly twelve years old, which would make me a Digital Immigrant, but I have completely lost my “accent” and am still considered younger than the age Prensky regarded Digital Immigrants as being.  This would make me neither a Digital Immigrant nor a Digital Native, or indistinguishable at least.  However, had I needed to identify myself among one of these two extremes, which have much variance within their categories, I would lean closer to a Digital Native.  Many Digital “smart” Immigrant teachers (as Prensky coins them) would most likely label themselves as Digital Natives as well after so many years of exposure to technology, even though they are immigrants after all.\\n            I don’t think that being a Digital Native or Digital Immigrant has many implications these days on their role as teachers as long as the teacher can make their teaching current and relevant.  Any teacher (Digital Native or Immigrant) can fall into old habits of teaching the ways they were taught, whether old fashioned or progressive, no matter how tech savvy they are.  Knowing does not always translate to doing; it is how you use this knowledge that counts. And, in modern times, one may have this knowledge as much as the other. “Digital Native” or “Digital Immigrant” labels should not be used to describe technical skill sets or fluency (as is implied in the Prensky article) beyond the definitions I have used in the second paragraph above, because both have the capabilities of being technologically \"current\". \\n            Presky presents some points that are also quite valid today, mainly that teachers need to change their teaching methodology and content in order to fit the particular students they are teaching.  It is the teacher’s role to keep the Digital Native and Digital Immigrant students current and to speak to their experiences and prior knowledge in order to make the content relevant, by any means possible (whether it may include using technology or not).\\n ,\\n8,648,1,Hey Curtis, just to let you know, I think we are suppose to post the entire response as a message, not in a link.  Just a heads up!,\\n8,649,1,While I agree with Prensky’s major premise (that ‘digital immigrant’-educators must work to meet the changing needs of digitally informed youth who learn differently and have different opportunities than they did), I question some of his assertions. The first is the implied notion that all those born into an age of ‘digital nativity’ are comfortable with, have access to and learn better through a digital medium.  Though I grew up with a computer, web access, learning software and games and computer courses, I am today far less ‘plugged-in’ than many of my peers. I think that this has been a result of learning that the way a lot of digital communication and learning happens isn\\'t in line with how I learn and like to communicate.\\n   I lack a great deal of the specific knowledge that would satisfy some definitions of what it means to be ‘digitally literate’. Students who grow up speaking and reading the same language achieve different levels of literacy. I may be more or less ‘digitally native’ than someone growing up in the same time and place as myself, because of difference in accessibility, ability and interest. I think this difference within cohort exists currently and will continue to exist. So, while we will definitely see more and more technology in all aspects of public education, I believe we also need to look at where the decision to not use technology may be beneficial. As the CEO of a software company, I’m sure Prensky would like to believe that all learners can benefit to a degree which justifies the pervasive use of technology for learning, but I am not yet convinced that is the case.\\n   I have used technology in my teaching and could not imagine a tech-less classroom going forward, but I have also seen technology used to poor effect in my work as a language teacher, even when well thought out and well intentioned. Part of the failure came from student’s lack of interest in sitting in front of screens to learn, but a lot of it comes from teacher’s inability to use technology in a creative and interesting way that engages students and respects the level of understanding they have of technology. If you remember the terrible, outdated, low-fi 1970’s BBC productions of Macbeth and Lear that were shown to many students even in the 1990’s, you might see a parallel; if students are used to a certain quality of media in their personal lives, any attempt to use the same media that falls short is going to fail. So, with Prensky, I do believe that teachers should be thinking hard and making an effort to be creative with the use of technology. However, I also think that this is simply not the strength of some teachers. We can make it a duty for teachers to use technology, but it doesn’t mean they’re going to use it well, so it may defeat our purpose. I believe that a lot of great teaching can happen in a technologically-sparse environment, and that it’s going to take time for ‘digital natives’ to make up the majority of those in the teaching profession.\\n   \\n\\n ,\\n8,651,1,When first discussing the concept of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants in class, I felt that I am much more of a Digital Native. This belief was influenced by the fact that my iPhone feels like an extension to my body and I find it difficult to remember a time when I wasn’t using a computer or the internet in school.  After reading and thinking more about Prensky’s article, I still feel more closely connected to the experiences of Digital Natives; however, I can now also see where I identify with some of the experiences of Digital Immigrants. I know that I have been heavily influenced and taught by Digital Immigrants throughout the majority of my education and many of their tendencies, dispositions and beliefs may have manifested within me as well. For example, when I read the quote, “Today’s average college grads have spent less than 5,000 hours of their lives reading, but over 10,000 hours playing video games,” I was shocked like many Digital Immigrants likely would be as well. It saddens me that many students today may not enjoy reading as much as I did as a child. I find it easiest to define my identity in comparison to others and where I believe they fit on the digital spectrum. To explain, I am much more of a Digital Native than my older sisters because I am accustomed to school life filled with computers, but I feel far less of a Digital Native than many of the students I have taught because I am adjusting to school life filled with smart phones and tablets and all of their capabilities.\\n            My experience in writing this paper today in itself provides a window into my dual identity. As I write this paper, my Digital Native nature shines through because I am sitting in a Starbucks and drafting my paper on my laptop instead of by hand, and to find this Starbucks an hour ago I quickly pulled up Google maps on my iPhone while I simultaneously checked my iCalendar and texted a friend. However, I am extremely aware that I have not developed many of the skills or tendencies of Digital Natives that Prensky discusses like being able to “parallel process” or work at a faster speed while multitasking. My “accent” as a Digital Immigrant is evident right now in the fact that I need to print out a copy of my work to edit it. On a daily basis, I reconcile the skills I learned from Digital Immigrants in my schooling with the new opportunities that technology provides.\\n            While my dual identity could positively affect my teaching, I am finding myself increasingly worried about my ability to keep up with my students and their rapidly developing “language.”  The thought that today’s students may “think and process information fundamentally differently from their predecessors,” including me, is both alarming and motivating. I find it alarming because of quotes in the article like, “[Digital Immigrants choose to teach] slowly, step-by-step, one thing at a time, individually, and above all, seriously.” That is certainly not how I want to teach, but I worry that I will because I might not actually have a true sense of who my students are (as pure Digital Natives) and how to best support them in their “language.” All that being said, the optimist in me finds the same quote motivating because I know that if I invest time and effort I can learn new technology quickly and apply it in my future classrooms.   \\n            I agree with Prensky that our educational system is not designed for today’s students, and I feel that change is due so I know I must be open and committed to keeping pace with what is best for my students. For example, while I have always envisioned my future classrooms being filled with books, I am now considering whether eBooks could be a better way to serve my students in the future.\\n            Prensky says, “Is it that Digital Natives can’t pay attention, or that they choose not to? Often from the Natives point of view their Digital Immigrant instructors make their education not worth paying attention to compared to everything else they experience – and then they blame them for not paying attention!” After thinking about this, I have decided that the onus is on me to bridge the gap between my students and me and to ensure that my content and methodology reflects the lives and nature of my students. I realize that this will require addition investments in my professional development (i.e. learning more “future content” myself), so that I can teach in ways that work for today’s students.  As Prensky puts its, “going faster, less step-by step, more in parallel, with more random access” will likely be a challenge, but I believe it can revolutionize and energize my teaching.,\\n8,653,6,Since the age of 7, I have spent much time using computers, videogames, digital music players, cellphones and the Internet. Technology has been especially important to me in terms of socializing – from chatting with friends on ICQ and MSN, to Facebook, and BBM and text messaging. More recently, Instagram has become a medium I use to interact with friends. From a young age, I have also felt that my writing flows better using a word processor than with pen and paper. I have had positive experiences using technology for academic purposes. Therefore, I identify with Prensky’s definition of a Digital Native.\\n  Being immersed in technology from such a young age has shaped my use of technology and my values associated with using it in my social, academic and professional life. I am constantly “plugged in” to my Macbook and iPhone and believe in the benefits of technology (especially Apple products!). The value I place on technology in my personal life has transferred in to a belief in using technology as a tool for teaching.\\n  I am continuously searching for new ways to use technology to best fit my personal needs. I integrate new applications easily into my personal routine. Most recently, I discovered the usefulness of the reminders app. This synchronizes my list of tasks on my cellphone and computer and I am able to set an alarm to remind me of individual tasks. Reminders has replaced my daily to do lists, which I used to write out on post-it notes. I feel that the practice of reflecting on my own use of technology will follow me into the classroom. Further, I am excited to learn about new technologies from peers, through blogs and discussions in the MT program.\\n  For me technology’s efficiencies outweigh the “learning curve.” I feel that technology allows me to do everything more efficiently from planning and organizing to collaborating with peers (Google Docs and Facebook). I share my excitement of new technologies with my peers and encourage their use. When I am unsure of how to use an application, I often persevere and troubleshoot, whether that is through reading message boards or asking friends for help. My passion for technology has guided me to this topic for my MTRP and I am researching what experiences and beliefs shape teachers who integrate technology in their classroom.\\n  Although I am a Digital Native, I disagree with Prensky’s firm definition of Digital Immigrant. He argues that as a Digital Immigrant learns, he or she adapts to the new environment but always retains a foot in the past (Prensky, 2001. P. 2). I believe Prensky is trying to argue that individuals who have not grown up surrounded by technology do not fully embrace technology, and still do many things “the old fashion way.” I feel that a more important predictor of how people use technology is their values, which they can develop later in life. My AT in her late 40s exemplifies this. She was technologically savvy because she valued technology. She explored the Internet for various applications of technology, used an iPad regularly and truly embraced technology for all the benefits it can offer both her and her students. She was able to integrate technology into her teaching effectively. I saw students engaged and feel as though their values were represented in her classroom.\\n  In conjunction with my value of technology, I believe in teaching 21st century skills. Prensky complains that students today cannot learn the names, populations, capitals and relationships of all 101 nations in the world. I do not agree that students should be memorizing anything. As teachers we need to help foster 21st century skills such as creativity & innovation, communication, critical thinking & problem solving and collaboration. Memorization of facts is irrelevant in the age of the Internet.\\n  I agree with Prensky that role of the classroom teacher needs to change in the 21st century. However, I disagree with the way he proposes it should change - in the form of \"edutainment\" I feel that technology can engage students when used in a meaningful way in the classroom – which is not necessarily “edutainment.” This is something I hope to learn more about in my MTRP. I hope that my experiences and values associated with technology will positively influence my use of technology in the classroom. I strongly believe that to make our teaching culturally relevant, we should be infusing our lessons with technology. ,\\n8,654,7,       Marc Prensky’s Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants speaks directly to one of the most fundamental problems facing education today.  The term Digital Natives, Prensky suggests, describes the generation of students in schools from kindergarten through to grade twelve who see themselves as disconnected from teachers and a curriculum, which is “old school” in nature.  This “old school” mentality is used to describe the Digital Immigrants, who are foreign to new technology and less willing and perhaps less able to adopt its culture in their respective professional and personal lives.  The distinction between these two cultures, the Digital Immigrants and the Digital Natives, has great implications for me as a teacher entering the classroom in the 21st century.\\n         Before effectively discussing the implications of this cultural divide for me as a teacher, it is important to establish where I see myself in this fragmented discussion of old versus new.  While I believe Prensky successfully articulates many of the critical problems, which arise from this cultural divide, I feel he only provides an arena of extremes in which we are asked to find a reflection of ourselves. However, I cannot honestly say that I identify exclusively as an immigrant or a native, instead I feel caught somewhere in the middle of this dichotomy.  In other words, while I am neither afraid of technology nor resistant to its increasingly active role in our various environments, it is also not intuitive for me.  Consequently, I feel that I belong in a different category, one that is not presented in this article but what might be coined as a first-generation native.\\n         As I begin to think about the implications this will have on my teaching, I think back to my practicum experiences and my willingness to engage with technology in the classroom.  Based on my own upbringing with what today might be described as basic technology, such as a laptop as an integral part of my life, I cannot imagine teaching without some basic technological integration.  With that being said, I am motivated to pursue my own professional development to learn how to incorporate newer technologies such as SMART Boards and iPads into my teaching as the operation of these newer devices does not come intuitively to me the way they might for Digital Natives, nor do they alarm me the way they might the Digital Immigrants.\\n         One thing that stands out to me as I reflect on Prensky’s paper is the limited access my students and associate teachers had to technology both in the classroom and for many students at home as well.  This limited access is not something that Prensky addresses in his article.  Rather, he assumes that all students have spent “their entire lives surrounded by and using computers, videogames, digital music players, video cams, cells phones, and all the other toys and tools of the digital age.”  Still, I think this paper is a great contribution to the discussion on technology and its role in the classroom.  Too often I find people use limited access as a mask for their own unwillingness to learn new technologies.  As teachers we must commit to our own professional development on effective technology integration in the classroom.  That commitment should stem from the responsibility we have to our students to ensure the learning in the classroom be as meaningful and relevant as possible.  By describing students today as those who “have little patience for lectures, step-by-step logic, and ‘tell-test’ instruction,” Prensky is convincing in his argument for more technology in the classroom coupled by a movement towards “adapting materials to the language of Digital Natives.” \\n         Ultimately, in describing myself as a first-generation native, I feel I have had enough experience with technology embedded in my upbringing that I am able to approach new technologies willingly and with an open mind.  Prensky speaks to the need for reform in our school system as too many students are failed by the system that is in place today.  While I feel he neglects to address some of the limitations in moving towards the Digital Native way, I am optimistic that we are at the forefront of some major pedagogical changes that will ultimately lead to increased student engagement and therefore student success.\\n ,\\n8,655,2,  Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants – Personal Response\\n                    This article echoes my belief that, over the last decade, a significant “generational gap” has developed between teachers and students in our education system. I have observed, from both the perspective of a student and of a teacher, a discernible disconnect between pedagogy and student engagement, between curriculum content and meaningful learning, between teachers and students. Prensky’s article, Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, attributes this gap to the arrival and growing accessibility of digital technology; this “singularity” has changed the fundamental way in which children of the 21st century socialize, communicate, think, process information, and learn (Prensky, 2011). Prensky likens many teachers to immigrants in this digital world – foreigners who fail to understand the progressive language and culture of the Digital Natives, our students, and, ultimately, fail to teach effectively.\\n                    Prensky points out distinct differences in Digital Immigrant teachers’ “outdated”, traditional pedagogy and the needs of our Digital Native students. Multi-tasking, parallel processing, access to visuals, instant gratification, and experiential interactions are but a few of the necessary components that contribute to a Digital Native student’s learning and level of engagement (Prensky, 2011). In order for Digital Immigrant teachers to meet the needs of our students, we must acknowledge our professional inadequacies, develop understandings of new instructional approaches that engage our students, integrate new methodologies in our pedagogy, and continue to reflect and improve as educators. Prensky suggests that we must modify our pedagogy by moving away from “step-by-step” instruction and allowing our students to approach curriculum content from a “big-picture” perspective. I believe that we need to provide our students with more freedom in their learning. We must reflect this in our teaching practices by providing students with opportunities to explore content holistically, learn experientially, focus on process over product, and demonstrate their learning in a variety of ways.\\n                    As I reflect on my experiences as a teacher candidate, I can understand the undertones of urgency in Prensky’s article. During one of my teaching practicums, I incorporated Powerpoint and SmartBoard technologies in many of my math lessons. The lessons that I designed involved hands-on problem solving, group work, and extensive discussion between students. I was astonished to see the level of excitement and appreciation that the students expressed – it had been the first time that year that they experienced a lesson that incorporated technology, as well as instruction differing from traditional “chalk and talk”. I continued to develop engaging and experiential math lessons and was pleased to observe high levels of engagement, learning, and understanding from the students. Contrastingly, the literacy lessons that I taught did not prove to be as successful. It was my first time teaching literacy and my unfamiliarity with the subject was revealed in my lesson plans. Upon reflection, the language lessons I delivered were rigidly-structured and teacher-driven, leaving little room for student involvement, collaboration, and exploration of content. Why did the design and effectiveness of my lessons vary so dramatically? Relating my teaching experience to Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, I believe I can attribute the successes and failures of my lessons to the pedagogy behind them. My math lessons allowed for students to think critically and to take command of their learning – they didn’t require mastery of content prior to engaging in lesson activities. Rather, the students learned key concepts through experience and discussion with classmates. On the other hand, the literacy lessons I delivered were structured from “bottom to top”; mechanics and form were emphasized before student opportunities to express their views and engage in meaningful discussions.\\n                    It is apparent that teachers need to let go of “traditional” teaching values and accept that our students require pedagogy that embraces their culture, learning style, and “language”. This article was particularly interesting to me because I had always thought that my generation could serve as a “bridge” between the children of today and the generation before me. I feel that my peers and I had the privilege of growing up with much of the present technologies, albeit not to the same extent of today’s youth, but with enough familiarity to embrace and smoothly transition into new digital developments. I see the role of my generation, especially embodied through the position of an educator, as an important one. We have the base knowledge and understanding of digital technology, as well as the cultural and social implications that come with it. My generation of teachers will have an opportunity to capitalize on this knowledge to better engage our students and provide them with rich learning opportunities that embraces their way of thinking.\\n ,\\n8,656,3,     Today’s world, especially the way in which society operates, is completely different from years past. Though technology has existed in our world for many years, the constant advancements in technology, which seem to be advancing at an unprecedented rate, have created a society that moves at a pace in which it is difficult to keep up! Evidently, these technological advancements continue to impact all areas of work and play, and of living, in general. In particular, the education system has undergone and continues to undergo some drastic changes, manipulating and tailoring the practices of educators and students.\\n       Prensky states that, “today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach”. The author discusses that these new students, or Digital Natives, are born into the digital world and live and breathe technology, whereas Digital Immigrants are those individuals who have taken up bits and pieces of novel technology after birth and later on in life, slowly adjusting the way in which they do things. I appreciate Prensky’s classifications of the dichotomy.\\n       In reflecting on this article, it is difficult for me to fully identify with either a Digital Native or a Digital Immigrant, and therefore, I believe that I am a mixed breed of the two. From my earliest memories at Montessori school, I do not recall ever using computers or even seeing computers in the classroom. I do recall a PC computer in my basement, which I did not use until I was about five years old, and when I did use it, which was not very often at all, I recall playing two computer games, McGee and Mickey Mouse. I do remember feeling that the computer was a very special privilege since it was different from the rest of my toys and games.\\n          During my intermediate years, I recall going to computer class where I learned some basic but necessary skills such as how to use the keyboard, and eventually, how to use the Internet. In high school, I began using computers much more frequently and teachers began expecting students to submit most assignments in typed format. Throughout university, technologies (i.e. computers, laptops, smartphones, online learning modules, clickers, etc.) have been an integral part of my education and lifestyle. However, I do take pride in taking handwritten notes, attending face-to face lectures, and enjoying some traditional teaching.\\n       It is fascinating to learn that the brain structures of today’s students are different from those students in the past, including myself. Even more captivating is how thinking has changed and how our reliance on technology is so much greater today than it has ever been. As teachers, we often teach based on what we know and how we have come to learn what we know. I think Prensky is correct when he explains that some Digital Immigrant educators are not only speaking “an outdated language” to their Digital Native students, but they are also resistant to change. I empathize with them as a part of me is a Digital Immigrant, and I find it difficult to change my habits and the approaches of teaching and learning that I grew up with. At times, I find technological advancements overwhelming, frustrating, and distracting, but this does not stop me from pursuing and adapting to technological advancements.\\n       Prensky seems to put importance on learning through technological games. I find computer games, whether they are for learning purposes or not, to be unsatisfying. Learning should be fun but it should not always be associated with playing games. There exist arrays of technological advancements that enhance learning and can capture the attention of Digital Natives, and Prensky should address these to be on an equal playing field as computer games. For my own classroom, I hope to discuss with my students, their individual learning needs and inquire about their access and comfort with technology. It is not fair to assume that all students will have equal access to technology nor is it right to assume that they are all equally comfortable with the Digital Native lifestyle. These are some issues that Prensky fails to address.\\n       Prensky is convincing in his discussion on how Digital Natives have minimal patience for traditional teaching practises. As a soon-to-be teacher and a mixed breed, it is important for me to understand the diverse needs of my Digital Native students and how their needs will likely not be the same as mine. In saying this, by the time I am a teacher, there will most likely be novel technological advancements in which I will need to develop fluency so that I can not only connect with my students but also provide them with a learning environment in which they see themselves reflected and therefore, have more of an opportunity to excel.\\n ,\\n8,657,1,,\\n8,658,1,  Personal Response on Digital Natives/Digital Immigrants\\n              Reflecting on my elementary and secondary school years I realize that my childhood experiences differ significantly from those of today’s youth. For the majority of my elementary years the only forms of technology I utilized were television and the home phone.  These technologies were moderately monitored by my parents and thus they never became problematic for me. I preferred to spend my free time playing outdoors with my sister and friends, reading a good book, or playing with my toys. My family’s first home computer did not arrive until I was in grade six. Without Internet connection the computers sole purpose in my home was to allow me to print assignments. This was always a very time consuming task as the printer took approximately 25 minutes to print a single page! High school brought access to new and better technologies. During this time I was also given my first cell phone, had access to high speed Internet and began to use my computer to watch videos, listen to music and chat with friends online on MSN.\\n            My experiences with technology definitely identify me as a Digital Immigrant. Although I was not born into a digital world my comfort with technology continues to increase. Over the years technology has gained a more prominent role in my day-to-day functioning. Today, I cannot leave home without my iPhone, a device I use not only for talking, chatting, and Internet browsing but also as a GPS, translator and camera. I like to think of myself as an ever learning Digital Immigrant with a slight accent, obvious when I still need to print documents in order to read or edit them.\\n            As a teacher I am aware that my upbringing and experience with technology will be remarkably different than that of my students.  As a result of these differences, the education system and specifically my teaching style and my approach must coincide with the interests and needs of present students. According to Prensky (2001) Digital Natives are accustomed to receiving instant information, enjoy multi-tasking and “prefer games to ‘serious’ work” (p. 2). In my opinion the learning style of any student should never be questioned but rather accepted, respected and embraced. This ideology is not exclusive to the digital natives we will find in our own classrooms. I am aware that my own identity, that of a Digital Immigrant, may potentially impact my role as a classroom teacher. In order to reach and teach my students effectively I must understand that although my personal educational experience was effective for me, that same approach will probably not work with my own students. I must aim for a constructivist approach, where students actively participate, have the opportunity to multi-task, and use technology to explore as well as demonstrate their learning. I agree with Prensky (2001) that we as teachers do not have to reinvent the wheel but we must adapt materials to the language of the digital natives in our classroom.\\n            Identifying that my learning experience was strikingly different from that of my future students is the first step in moving towards a teaching approach that will better meet their needs. At times a personal reluctance to incorporate technologies might tempt me to rely on the teaching styles I was exposed to as a child. Partly this might be due to a fear of being humiliated for not knowing “easy technology” as a result of insufficient training or pressing time constraints. I realize however that what worked for me will probably not work for today’s student population. They are the drivers of technology today and my role will be to work with them to improve their learning experience. ,\\n8,659,5,As a fourteen year old boy in 2001, had I read Marc Prensky\\'s published article: \"Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants\", I would have identified with being a digital native. I used the internet, had a cell phone, a CD player, used Napster to download music, played video games and used ICQ to talk to friends. Today I would identify myself as a digital immigrant due to the constant advancement of technology and feeling out of the loop with newer forms of technology. Cell phones have multiple functions including texting, picture taking and internet surfing. CD players have become obsolete as iPods provide users access to thousands of songs in the palm of their hand. Some of these digital technologies I have been able to master quite easily (iPod, Laptops), but there are many others (iPad) that I am still learning how to use. Furthermore, there are some new technologies that I had not heard of until very recently (i.e. edmodo). Although I am still tech savvy and I am able to adapt to newer forms of technology, I feel that I am (and will continue to be) a digital immigrant.\\n  Marc Prensky writes  that \"today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach\" (Prensky, 2001, p. 1). While this is true, the educational system will never be able to catch up to today\\'s students. Digital technology will continue to progress and older forms of technology will become obsolete. Teachers will have trouble adopting technology into the classroom. Prensky says that \"our Digital Immigrant instructors, who speak an outdated language (that of the pre-digital age), are struggling to teach a population that speaks an entirely new language.\" (Prensky, 2001, p. 2), I do not believe that this is completely due to a misrepresentation of how students learn. Given that technology is constantly changing so fast and so quickly, teachers do not have the proper time to learn, assess, consider, and adopt technology into the classroom to its full potential. Teachers will always continue to struggle as they are immigrants in a native world.\\n   As an upcoming teacher I feel that adopting technology into the classroom will have its challenges. Some schools may have digital technologies that are cutting edge and extremely current. These technologies will take time and effort for me to learn properly and efficiently. There are other schools that are limited in their technological usage and thus I may be required to use old-fashioned methods. This presents an issue since, according to Prensky, today\\'s students learn differently than they did years ago. Even though students may \"like to parallel process and multitask\" (p. 2), I may not have the tools to maximize the learning needs of the students  Both of these scenarios are compounded by the fact that as a new teacher, I still have to find my place and establish the teacher that I want to be.\\n  However, even though I feel that I am digital immigrant, I hope to use technology as a way to both engage my students and teach the curriculum in a more effective way. Prensky states that digital immigrant teachers are reluctant to incorporate technology into the classroom. If the technology is available to use and students are using these new technologies, teachers should also keep up with the times as well. Despite feeling like a digital immigrant, I want to reach out the natives so I can optimize the learning needs of all of my students. There will be the challenge of not being an expert at new cutting edge technology, but if I am teaching to a native world, then it is important for me to not be afraid of making mistakes. Just like the students, I have to learn as well. In some cases, the teacher may learn from the students.\\n   While Prensky presents us with the ideal scenario of how to teach today\\'s students, I unfortunately think that this high standard is unattainable. However, I am hopeful that teachers today recognize the value that technology brings to the classroom. Teachers have the ability to use technology in incredible ways to help contribute to the teaching process. While teachers will always be considered immigrants, hopefully we can strive to be like the natives.\\n    Bibliography\\n  Prensky, M. (2001). Digital natives, digital immigrants. On the Horizon, 9(5), 1-6. Retrieved from http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky - Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants - Part1.pdf,\\n8,660,8,       As one of the youngest students in my MT cohort, I believe my school years are somewhat consistent with the technological experiences students encounter in today’s digital world. I recall growing up in a fast paced environment, where signing out resources from the library was becoming more and more uncommon as information was readily available with the click of a button. In other words, I was born into the world where the Digital Native phenomena already existed. In elementary school, I recall having weekly classes where my peers and I would go to the school computer lab to learn basic computer skills such as browsing the Internet, word processing and e-mail. While considering Prensky’s view in his article Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants (2001), I can see how many teachers fail to recognize that today’s students learn and process information differently. In regards to my own experiences, Prensky (2001) offers valid insight into ways teachers can better know and understand their students. Educators must acknowledge that students are permanently plugged into a network of digital devices, bringing the world to their fingertips in a way no previous generation has ever experienced. Currently, exploring basic computer skills and functions in school are mindless activities for most students whom already spend countless hours on the computer or playing video games at home. Reflecting back on my past experiences, many students were more technologically literate than their teachers, as such I can only begin to imagine the discontinuity that must exist in today’s classrooms.\\n         Today, students are born with an innate aptitude for technology that Digital Immigrants can only dream of. For some educators, this instills fear that perhaps students have become incapable of paying attention or run the risk of being “more capable” than their teacher. The Internet creates a new world of accessibility, and as a result, students have quick and easy access to “information” as do their educators. Many people argue that knowledge is “power”. Are Digital Immigrants afraid that students hold the same resources as they do? Personally, I believe the incorporation of technology in schools allows students to become active participants in the learning process. Ownership is no longer the responsibility of the teacher but rather students have the resources to take control. Although it is evident that students know more about various technologies than their teachers, I believe teachers must embrace these opportunities for students to become more empowered in the learning process. When students have the opportunity to excel in a particular area, students gain a strong sense of self-esteem and self-efficacy. Furthermore, if students are likely engaged and motivated to learn using technology; why would educators enforce “traditional” forms of learning that prevent student engagement? The minds of students are wired differently such that they process information quickly and require more hands-on interaction with digital devices. Rather than blame technology for why students “learn” differently, educators must acknowledge its benefits and embrace various technological tools as a means to accommodate all students. Technology has the ability to improve our education system such that teachers become facilitators of learning, rather than “carriers of knowledge”.\\n         Personally, I consider myself a Digital Native because I have grown up with technology as my main source for communication. However, technology is readily changing such that being yesterday’s Digital Native implies that my aptitude for technology is outdated. Luckily, I have witnessed the evolution of several technologies such that I may begin to critically analyze what new technologies will exist in the future. Students need to be given the opportunity to expand their thinking and ponder ways in which technology will continue to advance. They need to recognize that they are apart of a technological continuum such that one day current forms of technology will become obsolete. Although current students are today’s Digital Natives, they will become tomorrow’s Digital Immigrants.\\n                 Today, educators are competing with the latest technological tools that stimulate students far beyond the elements of the “traditional” school setting. As such, educators are forced to change their instructional strategies to include ways in which students can more readily process and think. New technologies lead the way for new educational practices. It is a vicious cycle in which educators must always be ready to alter their practice as new technologies become more readily available. ,\\n8,661,1,  According to Marc Prensky’s article “Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants”, Digital Natives are students who are “native speakers” of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet (1). Prensky defines Digital Immigrants as those who “learn” – “like all immigrants, some better than others – to adapt to their environment, they always retain, to some degree, their “accent,” that is, their foot in the past” (2). He further describes Digital immigrants as being older or “socialized” differently from their kids (Digital Natives), and “are now in the process of learning a new language” (2). The premise of Pensky’s concepts are that: “students have changed radically. Today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach.(1)” \\n  Personally, I find it challenging to identify with the poles that Pensky outlines in his article. As a student in elementary school, I used technology throughout my classes; a large part of my private school education was centered on technology and innovation. As I went through grade school and University, I have become increasingly fluent in digital technology - both in my professional and personal life. Essentially, I fall under the category of a Digital Native, according to Prensky’s definition, yet I do not believe that all technology or constant use of it is an asset to personal growth or an indicator of all future success of students. \\n  Prensky sets up a binary, an us versus them mentality of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, as if Digital Immigrants are somehow pedagogically insignificant.  It is logical that those who did not use technology during their early developmental stages may lack fluency or ease of use, depending on their exposure to technology, the idea that this somehow relates to the element of fun or engagement in a classroom is inherently flawed. The most engaging teachers I’ve had used empathy and humour to create a connection and build engagement - not technology.  Of course technology is an asset and a valuable tool, but the rhetoric that Prensky utilizes is really problematic throughout the article. \\nUltimately, I understand and believe that my use of technology assists students to build familiarity and strength taking risks with new modes of information and literacy, however, research has shown that the impact of increasing technology is an inherent problem with overstimulation. ADHD difficulties have been linked to overuse of technology, while studies show that mindfulness or outdoor education can be very beneficial, both for emotional well being and focus (Coughlan & Blakely, 2012). For my future classroom, differentiation has such a large part my purpose and design for using technology to stimulate student learning. \\n  The fundamental gap in Prensky’s article seems to be the idea that technology’s main asset is speed.  I felt that Prensky’s article privileged the fast paced video game style teaching, which seems to be based on instantly gratifying speed or constant novelty. I think this underestimates the depth of critical and emotional thinking students are capable of - which is a cornerstone of my philosophy and vision of teaching. Technology, whether used creatively, repetitively in a detail-oriented or data gathering way, should focus on using the skill-set of the individual student. It is true that technology is fast, but it is not always gratifying on a more spiritual or fundamental level. I think that being cognizant of the weaknesses as well as the strengths of using technology - both as students and teachers - are the basis of our successful use of it. \\n  Bibliography:\\nCoughlan, R. & Blakey, J.B.

When I think of digital immigrant, I think of my father, face down, parallel to the keyboard, typing with his pointer finger at a record high of 20 words per minute, or my mother who still uses her cell phone that does not even have a camera on it (gasp). As for the digital native, I think of my brother, a mere 5 years younger than I am, who has had a lap top since he was in grade 6 and can hook up his computer to the television without a detailed list of instructions and colour coded wiring tips. As for me, I reside somewhere in the middle; I will call myself a digital citizen.\\nI remember getting my very first family computer; I remember the sound of dial-up Internet and having an additional phone line installed just to explore on the amazing World Wide Web. Though I was still very young when I had my first encounters with technology, I was not born out of the womb with apple device in my hand like the present day digital natives.  I think being a digital citizen, however, gives me a “one up” as a teacher in the classroom. I appreciate the traditional chalk and talk classroom because much of my elementary and middle school years were just that. However, witnessing the digital boom and being fortunate enough encounter its usefulness in the classroom in my later high school and university years, I have seen both worlds and know what each has to offer.\\nBeing this sort of digital citizen, as I have called it, I have the opportunity to impart knowledge onto my students while remaining open minded and willing to infuse new technologies into my teaching. In other words, I have the opportunity to learn from my students’ different modes of technologically that best suit them or that interest them and figure out ways how integrate that into the curriculum. As a digital citizen, I have the open-mindedness where the digital immigrant would otherwise display reluctance and I have vulnerability that the digital native would otherwise display the inability to scaffold and instruct step by step.\\nThe benefit of the immigrant is that he has the ability to teach “slowly, step by step, one thing at a time, individually, and above all, seriously” (2). This ability still has its place in the classroom where no two students are alike and learn at different paces. However, for the students in the class “who have been networked most or all of their lives” (3), teachers need to be adequately equipped to occupy their attention with what Prensky refers to as “edutainment”, a fusion of education and entertainment.\\nPrensky recommends that in order to blur the line between the natives and the immigrants, in order to successfully teach our digitally native students, we must use our students as our guides. Being a digital citizen, I have the benefit of seeing the pro’s of the traditional classroom and the new age classroom which will undoubtedly inform how I teach and approach my own classroom.,\\n8,664,1,Hey Gang,\\nIt may be a few months late, but we thought that we\\'d put a description of SALT on Pepper.

I feel as though I grew up in a time when technology was present, however the focus of my education and/or personal life was not on the technologies themselves.  I feel as though we are now living in an age of technology. The way we communicate, create, collaborate, is reliant on the developing technological world.  As a student, from what I can recall, the technological integration in my classrooms began in grade 5.  We were given a weekly class on a program called “All the Write Type,” which allowed us to learn how to type on a keyboard.  It wasn’t until the seventh grade, and only be virtue of the specialized arts program that I was in, that I was exposed to technology on a daily basis.  The program is called CyberARTS, where we had an emphasis and extra classes in visual arts as well as in digital arts, such as animation, website building, digital portfolio creation, and so on.  I was a part of this program from grade 7 through to grade 12.  Although this program allowed me to become well versed in many computer programs such as Adobe Photoshop and other Adobe software, Flash, Dreamweaver, etc, I was not introduced to many other technological devices.  However, the ability to use computers as well as video equipment on a daily basis has impacted my views as not only a student, but as a teacher, in terms of how I will go about exposing students to technology and allowing them to be immersed in it. \\n            Although I see my younger self, and even parts of my current self, as a Digital Immigrant, I find myself connecting more and more with the Digital Natives.  I consider myself a Digital Immigrant because I am hesitant to use certain technologies due to my lack of knowledge and confidence in the material.  Yet, I find that today’s students are well versed in all varieties of technology and in order to make our teaching relevant, we need to tap into their technological minds.  It is not that I am as deterred from using technology as Prensky states Digital Immigrants are, I just lack the confidence to include such technologies.  However, I suppose you could say that as an adult, I am a Digital Native.  My entire experience in the MT program has promoted technological integration and has demonstrated how I, as a teacher, could integrate technology within the classroom.  Although I am being introduced to these new ways of integrating technology across the curriculum, I feel as though I myself will unfortunately not implement them as much as I would like.  This is not a reflection of my understanding of the use of some the technologies available, but has a direct connection with my lack of confidence and in my fear of technology consuming the classroom.  I fear that a lot of the traditional teaching methods, that I have witnessed to be successful, will disappear.  I think that it is important to acknowledge the benefits of technology, and because our students are so directly immersed in this new world, we as teachers need to be conscious of this.  If our teaching is to be relevant, which we are all striving for, then we need to include technology.  However, teachers need to be further educated, including myself, on how to use such technologies within our own classroom, whilst still being able to implement teaching methods that we are more comfortable with.  Overall, I think Prensky makes an extremely strong and relevant point in exposing the importance of the use of technology to further connect with our students and the changing ages.  He also quite clearly and effectively states the ‘defiance’ of Digital Immigrants in terms of using technology.  It is now up to new teachers, like myself, to break this divide. ,\\n8,666,1,  Personal Response to Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants by Marc Prensky\\n  As an elementary school student, I found my experiences to lack relevance and real world application. I was uninterested in copying from my history textbook to lined paper, and more interested in instant messaging or reading online blogs. During my junior years, any research assignment took weeks, as instructions were to find information through offline resources such as books and magazines. The same assignment could have taken a quarter of the time by using online search engines. I was living in a world that was rapidly evolving through technological advances. Students tended to these changes by experimenting with new programs and gadgets; however, education, on the other hand, disregarded the societal changes by leaving its system virtually unchanged.\\n  Marc Prensky begins his article by revealing that the education system is amid decline. This comes as a result of the system’s shortcomings to making teaching relevant and useful within society. Prensky explains, “Today’s students are no long the people our educational system was designed to teach.” (2001) Students are growing up with a dependence on technologies such as the Internet, cell phones and instant messaging. Since this is the first generation to grow up with the new technology, Prensky labels them as “Digital Natives”. While “Digital Natives” are familiar and comfortable with new technologies, those that are were not born into the technology age struggle with modeling this approach in the classroom. Prensky differentiates teachers from “Digital Natives” as he explains that they are less confident and trusting with technology. He identifies these people as “Digital Immigrants”.\\n  I didn’t think I was a “Digital Immigrant”. After reading Prensky’s article, I was disappointed to learn that many of my technological habits are in fact accents of a “Digital Immigrant”. While I may have signs of an accent, I do not fall under the generalizations made by Prensky. He argues that, “Digital Immigrant teachers don’t believe their students can learn successfully while watching TV or listening to music, because they can’t” (2001). Since I was growing up during the early developments of the digital age, I find myself more open to the idea that “Digital Natives” learn and communicate differently than others. Throughout the article, I found that Prensky was outdated in describing education, as the changes he promoted in methodology and content have already been put well into motion.\\n  Prensky argues that teachers must start by teaching to students as \"Digital Natives\", yet he admits to uncertainty in how to teach logic. While this article is innovative in transforming the entire system of teaching and education, this argument is completely flawed. One must know what they are teaching, and how they will achieve learning. Prensky’s methodology consists of technology integration and hoping for the best outcome. A methodology of teaching “Digital Natives” must have clear and achievable goals and purposes. Secondly, Prensky’s view of dividing content as “Legacy” and “Future” juxtaposes what he perceives as good and evil. This is problematic as both “traditional styles of learning” and new age learning must be integrated and used collaborately. By labeling one as “Legacy” it tells students that this is old and useless, whereas, identifying content with technology as “Future” is inaccurate and amplifies its usefulness to an exaggerated and unbalanced degree.\\n  In summary, Marc Prensky is innovative in his plea for a new paradigm towards teaching. While I agree with the fact that teaching must progress with the changes in society; I find that this article falls short as reduces the value of traditional education and the abilities of students. ,\\n8,667,1,The \"Flower Power\" book that Wesley suggested in class. \\n  http://www.enidlee.com/marcia20.htm,\\n8,668,1,For those of who were having trouble finding it (like me!) ,\\n8,669,2,  Laura Barrett  -- Response to \"Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants\" --- CTL 7016\\n     I am reluctant to categorize myself as either a digital native (DN) or digital immigrant (DI) when I so fundamentally disagree with the reductionist nature of Prensky\\'s theory. How can any generation be painted with the same brush based solely on age? The article ascribes to all students an equal, immediate proficiency with digital technology, and to their teachers a homogeneous inability to update their teaching methods. A cursory Internet search yielded several studies exploding this binary, reinforcing my initial distaste for its claims. I also object to the analogy made between digital technology and natural language, since a logical extension would conceive of ELL students as having fundamentally different brains from the English-speaking population: an absurd and insulting notion1.\\n   However ill-defined the distinction between them, the two groups may nonetheless serve as useful stand-ins for other practical concerns faced by teachers; e.g. how do we differentiate instruction to serve students with different learning needs? Fundamentally, the difference between a DN and a DI is one of comfort with technology, which might be best framed as a continuum of access in general. Some people find digital technology more readily accessible, owing to a multitude of factors2, and it is this spectrum of variability that I hope to address equitably and effectively in my teaching practice, perhaps especially since I conceive of myself as a DN.\\n   My childhood and adolescence afforded frequent and diverse exposure to digital technologies. When I was seven, an uncle gave me a home-constructed PC as a gift, and as the years went by, I watched the memory capacity and processing speed of my home computer increase exponentially. I used digital technologies (including online bulletin board systems) consistently in and out of the classroom, and in high school took a computer science class that covered the basics of Pascal. In short, I had access to digital technology throughout my developing years, and I explored it in ways that appealed to me; it was culturally positioned as both lifestyle tool and potential career.\\n   Though I did not choose to pursue computer science professionally, it was only because I developed a conceptual understanding of digital technology that I could make that an educated choice. I know that most aspects of a career as a programmer or coder do not appeal to me; this does not make me a digital immigrant any more than my lack of interest in the specifics of telephone wiring. Would Prensky argue that anyone who uses a microscope or piano should be able to assemble one? I am not a digital native due to any specialized programming skills; I am a digital native by virtue of being at ease with many different technological modalities, and being able to mobilize all the resources at my disposal to access and evaluate unfamiliar technological formats.\\n   When it comes to student disengagement and inertia, the alleged digital immigrants quoted by Prensky seem to be repeating timeless teacher complaints. Is it fair to pin it all on technology when there are myriad other factors at play? Conversely, are such problems solvable using technology alone? Why not also consider simulations, sport, art, or other modes of differentiated instruction?\\n   To me, it doesn\\'t seem occupationally or philosophically useful to conceive of one generation as being fundamentally different from another, when divergence within a group can far outstrip any demonstrable difference between groups. What is most important to account for and assess is each student\\'s individual comfort level with technology.\\n   I conceptualize technological literacy as part and parcel of critical inquiry. By encouraging my students to examine the scientific and cultural processes at work behind current digital technology, I will empower them to investigate future technologies that have not yet been developed. As there is no way we can stay on top of all current technological trends, we must set the stage for a fluidity of approach that transcends simplistic ideas of fluency. My students will be flexible and resourceful in adapting and teaching new technologies but, more importantly, they will continually refine their understanding of technology\\'s importance and impact, using modes of critical inquiry. That is what a digital native does, accent or no.\\n  References\\n  Haigh, G. (2011) Open University explodes myth of \\'digital native\\'. Merlin John Online.

A student that has instantaneous needs and wants, and that those needs and wants, trumps, or is more important on a personal level that that of anything education could currently accomplish, or at least accomplish at the time of writing.  To this, I want to throw Prensky’s theory out the window and wonder if he is viewing students/youth as simply an observation, as a scientist views a mouse inside a cage.  This article has infuriated me, not only for its view on students and of youth, but also the approach to technology as a life-choice rather than a tool with its own challenges and privileges, and lastly on the dichotomy he creates between ‘traditional’ learning and ‘modern/digital native’ learning. \\n            As a youth-worker and as an educator, I am absolutely appalled on his interpretation of students as being only part of a ‘twitch’ age, where everything is given to them quickly, and that as such that is all that they are connected to, this hyper-fast form of information receiving and giving.  Well, though it may be true that students do operate within systems of instantaneous connection, this isn’t all true as firstly not all have access (to be discussed when I address technology), but also that this type of information sharing and giving is in response to a larger system.  Almost all of the technologies that he mentions (YouTube, MTV, cell-phones) are predominately a form of entertainment, of such entertain is usually a disconnection, a way of getting away from the outside world.  Why are youth engaged is this entertainment technology then Prensky? Possibly because the world in which they live in has become quite large, and that there has been little discussion about what this means, and how students can interact with it for a greater and broader understanding. Does this mean that we should only interact with students at an entertainment (thus…edutainment) level? NO!  Students are willing and wanting, and can be engaged with curricular topics (including his dreaded ‘reading’) if we present with them an ability to have a dialogue with texts, that allow them to own their experiences, and relate seemingly ‘un entertaining’ texts to their own selves.  The answer is not to use entertainment to give them the information (thus perpetuating the ‘teach, test’ strategy Prensky seems to hate so much), but rather to address technology as a tool to help bridge that dialogue and that understanding of self and curricular matters. \\n            The aspect of technology and changing access to, is also an important one.  These days, new updates, new technology is constantly becoming available (Five years ago, iPads did not exist, now there are three generations of), at an alarming rate.  There is a demand, not just for technology sake, but also as a capitalist stake to constantly be producing, and updating.  This issue is one that schools face in the form of funding (If everything is changing, how do we give them the new and best?), but also, how are we expected to keep up with all of this technology, and be able to ‘edutain’ students with it, if it’s constantly changing around them.  Furthermore, though software and games change, learning and dialoguing with the world, true learning, and what I want students to take out of education (an ability to understand, adapt to, and question the world around them), does not.  To base our education, around edutainment that changes every few weeks, every few months is ridiculous and harming not only our teaching practice but also our students.   What do we do if the edutainment no longer interests them? Our lessons are ruined, and we may not be able to go forwards or backwards, something that Prensky frets about in his article himself.  Where as If we use technology as a tool to engage, and to encourage dialogue, discussion and learning, not as the medium of which to do it by, we can adapt, and grow, but still keeps the message and meaning.\\n            Also, though I know it is being used as a metaphor by Prensky, and that to him the term “Native” and “Immigrant” may seem like a useful way of describing those ‘born into’ a technological age, and those not, I feel that his use of the words ‘accent’, ‘Native’ and ‘immigrant’ are very loaded from a social-studies perspective, and I cringe each time I read one being used in that way.  Especially in his implications that those with ‘accents’ behave or do not behave in certain beneficial ways, and that in using this word that people with language, or cultural accents behave in similar ways, through linguistical association.\\n  This article makes me angry, on a lot of different levels.,\\n8,671,1,http://www.modrobotics.com/cubelets-kt06\\n  Extremely expensive and therefore probably not practical for school, but it\\'s soooo cool.\\n ,\\n8,672,1,As mentioned in class, one way to look at gendered power dynamics:\\n  (CIDA\\'s policy on Gender Equality in programming: http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/acdi-cida.nsf/eng/EMA-218123616-NN9)\\n  Objectives\\nTo advance women\\'s equal participation with men as decision makers in shaping the sustainable development of their societies;\\nTo support women and girls in the realization of their full human rights; and\\nTo reduce gender inequalities in access to and control over the resources and benefits of development.\\nGender Equity and Gender Equality\\nGender equity means being fair to women and men.

Same treatment, however, was found not necessarily to yield equal results. Today, the concept of equality acknowledges that women and men may sometimes require different treatment to achieve similar results, due to different life conditions or to compensate for past discrimination.\\nGender equality, therefore, is the equal valuing by society of both the similarities and the differences between women and men, and the varying roles they play.\\n(Excerpt from: An Integrated Approach to Gender-Based Analysis, Status of Women Canada, 2004.)\\n ,\\n8,673,4,  Reflection\\nDigital Natives, Digital Immigrants\\nAlicia Krumholz\\n “If we teach today how we taught yesterday we rob our children of tomorrow.”\\n – John Dewey\\n  I am technologically illiterate. From my family’s first computer, 15 years ago, to my new shiny Macbook Pro, I never took an interest in exploring the cyber world. However, the quote above really resonates with me. I understand the importance of teaching to our students in a way that is relevant, accessible, and engaging. Although I do see many reasons to incorporate technology into my teaching, I can also identify some problems. Throughout this reflection I, a digital immigrant, will address the implications that occur in our diverse school systems. \\n  While reading this article one point seemed to jump out at me, our students think and process information in different ways. They can access information through the touch of a button and interact socially through technology. Consequently, they need to learn different skills in order to function positively in society. In the article, Prensky states that today’s students have grown up in a radically different way; as a result, their brains have physically changed. In order to teach effectively to compliment this new way of learning, I must learn to incorporate technology.\\n  While complimenting this new way of learning, teachers who incorporate technology are also relating to their students, informing them in ways that are relevant to their world. At the end of the day many students will go home and play on their computers, watch videos on youtube, or play video games. If a teacher can bring some of these technologies into the classroom their students will be more engaged in the learning process.\\n  As a result of being a digital immigrant my students become the experts. Whereas some teachers might see this as a problem, I love that my students can correct or inform me. It levels the playing field and allows students to feel as though they are knowledgeable. I am happy to demonstrate to them that throughout life one is continually learning.\\n  While Prensky offers many positives to incorporating technology into the classroom, I can see some difficulties. He explains that many teachers use excuses like they do not understand technology. As a digital immigrant, I do not agree that this is an excuse; I believe this is a reality. If schools want their teachers to use technology in the classroom they need to give them the tools. This can be accomplished through professional development sessions and a principal or vice principal who values the use of technology in the classroom.\\n  Another issue of incorporating technology in the classroom is equity. Technology is expensive and many schools cannot afford to acquire it. Another issue of equity is students’ in a diverse classroom might have different accessibilities to technology. As a future educator I will be sensitive to this reality.\\n  The last issue I have with the consistent use of technology in a classroom is the students’ potential to lose their rote skills. Technology usually does things automatically (i.e. spell check). Students might lose the understanding of the importance of spelling, calculating, looking up words in the dictionary, etc. All of these skills, although easily performed using technology, hold some value.\\n  The use of technology has the ability to engage students in learning and teach them how to be successful in today’s society. As a digital immigrant I will strive to use technology in a cautious, thoughtful, and meaningful way, helping students to thrive. ,\\n8,675,1,  When digital natives get to talking about how much “geek cred” they have (credibility as self proclaimed geeks), they usually start by listing the oldest and most rudimentary piece of technology they ever owned or worked on. My 10 year old self was the lucky recipient of an AST desktop computer with a 116MHz intel processor, 1.14 gb hard drive, 16 mb of RAM, and a 56k dialup modem. It was a hunk of junk compared to my smartphone, which would have seemed like alien technology if seen at the time.\\n  I am a digital native, having surfed the internet before it was actually as useful as it is today. I was part of online forums, and was thus connected to people across the world. I have witnessed first-hand the evolution of technology, rejoicing every time a hurdle I had identified was overcome by engineering and efforts of the online community. Having been so immersed in this world, I can now point out digital immigrants, no matter how faint their “accent”.\\n  I can identify with Prensky’s idea that digital natives process ideas differently from digital immigrants. I spend a lot of time translating back and forth when I want to explain my ideas, or when I want to understand the ideas of immigrants. Of note, I must add that these digital immigrants come in all ages and varieties. There are people that seem to be natives, but have really only mastered the Apple system. Furthermore, not all young people are natives. Being a native is a way of thinking. When one is a native, they tend to be able to understand how to interact with the technology, because they have adapted to the general way that the hardware and software engineers design their products. It is for this reason that my primary concern as a digital native is how to communicate with immigrants and bring them into my world.\\n  One of the points I can identify with best in Prensky (2001) is that of digital immigrants thinking that technology will somehow not apply to a certain class or subject. We have reached the point at which technology can be integrated into anything. A digital native will go out of their way to integrate technology, even by jerry-rigging technology they have (if I saw a tutorial for a technology that I don’t have, I can replicate it with the technology I do have via some MacGyver style engineering).\\n  My greatest concern now is that my students will somehow be more “native” than me. I started playing with tech when I was 10; now there are 2 year olds fiddling with iPads. I cannot help but wonder how different their brains will be in terms of recalling info (shorter?), scanning info for relevancy (faster?), and more. I believe it will take time for them to dictate the direction technology takes (grown ups make decisions), but I hope to be a flexible enough “immigrant” to adapt to them when the time comes.,\\n8,678,1,Response to “Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants” by Marc Prensky\\n              As I read the article “Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants”, I could not help but wonder whether I was a digital native or a digital immigrant.  Prensky identifies that the dissemination of digital media that occurred at the end of the 20th century has changed the fundamentals of how today’s students learn.  When I think back to my education, I don’t remember using much technology at all.  During elementary school, we rarely used computers; other than the few times that we went to the library to practice typing.  When I was in high school, I took a geography course that centered on the use of computers and GIS mapping software.  Apart from that and the odd PowerPoint presentation, I don’t remember much use of technology at all in my classrooms.  In my personal life, I had access to computers from a very young age, although for much of my childhood, it was not something that I used or needed every day.  I find that today, I generally feel comfortable using various technologies, but at a basic level when compared to their potential uses.  Hearing of the many technologies available to us as teachers, as well as witnessing the ease with which some students use various technologies, has made me realize that I do not identify as a digital native.  I cannot, however, say that I identify completely with Prensky’s description of a digital immigrant, and for this reason I would place myself somewhere in between the two.   I grew up with access to technology, and have a certain level of comfort with it, but it did not truly play a larger role in my life until my late teenage years and early adulthood.\\n              As I progress through the MT program, I find that I increasingly believe that technology should play a large part in our classrooms.  At the beginning of the article, Prensky mentions that the way that students think and process information is fundamentally different than it was not too long ago, prior to the rapid introduction and development of new technology.  I think that this is something that today’s teachers need to be mindful of when planning their lessons.  However, I do recognize that integrating technology into the classroom can be a challenging endeavor.  While I have learned of the many technologies available to us, and I whole-heartedly agree with the importance of it’s use in the classroom, I do not feel confident that I will be able to incorporate technology into my classroom as much as I would like to.  I feel a little bit lost in this space between being a digital native and digital immigrant and that I am being pulled both ways.  I would love to incorporate technology into my classroom, but apart from workshops and in-class demonstrations, I have never seen a successful and large-scale implementation of technology in the classroom, which makes me wonder how I am going to be able to do it.\\n              As teachers, we are constantly learning.  As we progress through our teaching careers, we will find ways to refine our practices.  Much of what we do as teachers, particularly when trying something new, is trial and error, and I believe that this applies to the use of technologies as well.  We must try new things and step outside of the comfort zone of the traditional teaching styles that many of us experienced as students.  I think that the first step is recognizing that it is important to adapt our teaching methods to our ever-changing society.  If we don’t, the disparity between a student’s experiences in their personal life, and their experiences in their schooling life will continue to grow.  It is important to close that gap and to provide a curriculum and classroom experience that is relevant.  Although I am not fully confident in my ability to use the various technologies available to us in the classroom, I do believe it to be an important aspect of teaching, and I am confident in saying that I am willing to try, and I am excited to learn.,\\n8,679,1,Growing up in the nineties, I would consider myself on the border between a Digital Native and a Digital Immigrant. I believe that there is a wide range of both Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, but after reading Prensky’s article I would fall under the Digital Native Category. On one hand I am not the most technological savvy person, however I understand how to use the different forms of technology and I take advantage of these technologies using them on a daily basis.\\n  The article reminded me of an incident that occurred during my first practicum. My associate teacher had typed up his hand written class notes, and had accidentally deleted them from his computer. During a lesson that day, he asked if I could retype them for him. I agreed to do so, it was mostly text with a couple of simple line-diagrams. In my opinion it wasn’t a very difficult task, however my associate teacher was very impressed by the fact that I was able to recreate the line-diagrams on the computer in a short period of time. He admitted that he was at a disadvantage for being less technologically inclined. He made the analogy stating that he was still making fire by rubbing sticks together, while I was using a lighter.    \\n  Once again, creating line-diagrams on a computer isn’t a technological phenomenon but even this simple skill can change a lesson plan. With a very intense curriculum timing is of great importance. Before I added the diagrams on to the computer, my AT would have to stop his lesson in order to draw them on the board. Whether or not teachers are Digital Natives or Digital immigrants, technology is a relevant and important aspect in teaching in the 21st century. Today students access some sort of technology on a daily basis. In many cases it is the first thing they do when they wake up, (smartphones, i-pads) and the last thing they do before they go to bed.  \\n  Being a Digital Native or a Digital Immigrant can definitely impact ones role as a teacher. During a technology in education workshop a quote was stated, ‘technology if used properly could make a lesson twice as effective, but if used incorrectly it could make it ten times worse.’ As Prensky argues we do not only have to teach Legacy content, but Future content in the language of our students who are Digital Natives.\\n  It is evident that there are many different learning and teaching styles. As a future educator it is essential to be able to adapt your teaching style(s) to meet the learning style(s) of your students. In teaching in the 21st century, we must not only meet curriculum expectations but it is important on how we are teaching to these expectations. Prensky describes how it is more difficult in ‘learning new ways to do old stuff’. Furthermore, with advanced technology such as smart phones, information can be retrieved in matter of seconds. How does this influence ones pedagogy? For example, is there a point in memorizing specific dates in history? Technology can be used to enhance learning, but an overall goal across the curriculum is to promote and develop critical thinking. Fundamental education tools will always serve a purpose, but in my classroom, as a Digital Native I promote questions of how and why to become superior to what and when.  Our students are the future, we must act as vehicles in assisting our students in achieving their goals.    ,\\n8,680,1,great job,\\n8,681,3,Attendees: Yuri, Curtis, Tim, Sara, Zack, Josh, Lesley, Emily, Laura Barrett\\n\\n\\nNo class representataives from PJ1 and JI1 attended.Â \\n\\n\\nAction item: Yuri to contact PJ1 and JI1 class representatives and find out if there was a miscommunication\\n\\n\\nÂ \\n\\n\\nCommunication Reps: The following people will represent their cohorts in the communication commitee:\\n\\n\\nÂ \\n\\n\\nIS2: Stephen, Emily\\n\\n\\nJI2: Laura Barrett, Alicia\\n\\n\\nPJ2: Elizabeth, Leslie\\n\\n\\nIS1: Anton, Katherine McDougall\\n\\n\\nJI1: Unkown at this stage.\\n\\n\\nPJ1: Shiva, Laura Wasserman\\n\\n\\nÂ \\n\\n\\nPre Practicum Potluck:Â  Thursday, October 18th, 12PM, 5-170\\n\\n\\nhttp://mtsa.sa.utoronto.ca/2012/09/29/fall-pre-practicum-potluck/\\n\\n\\nClass reps:\\n\\n\\n- Please invite faculty and remind students about the eventÂ \\n\\n\\n- Zack will talk to Jim about potential funding for plates and cutlery.Â \\n\\n\\nÂ \\n\\n\\nGrad Celebration Planning:Â  Next meeting is on October 16th at room 444.Â \\n\\n\\n3 venues were suggested so far.

Buried beneath the hyperbole, generalizations, and racist analogies are some important challenges to teachers that cannot go unconsidered or unanswered.  But by segregating the student and teacher population into two dichotomies that never meet, he has undermined his very argument – that the gap must be bridged – and renders his premise virtually useless.\\n  I therefore reject Prensky’s Manichean separation between digital natives and immigrants. I myself am proof that a person can exhibit qualities of both camps.  My formative years occurred before the ascendancy of the internet, and I have a foot firmly with the digital immigrants.  I like to call my friends.  I look up words in a physical dictionary.  I take notes by hand.  I can go for days without being on the internet.\\n  But educational and personal immersion in technology have turned me into a digital immigrant.  I can take notes on the computer, and relish the quick efficiency.  I also do all my writing and editing on the computer.  I can go for days just staring at the computer and running four programs simultaneously.  My skills in both areas have allowed me to survive and adapt in ways that others, used to only one toolbox, have not.  I lie outside the native-immigrant dichotomy, and I am not alone.  Prensky\\'s premise is far too limiting to represent even a small slice of the population.\\n  Instead, I prefer to align myself with White and Le Cornu’s system of categorization, that of digital residents vs. digital visitors (White and Le Cornu, 2011).  Prensky’s analogy wrongly draws a strict correlation between aptitude and age; White and Le Cornu’s binary, while equally limiting, at least provides the populace with a measure of free will and divides digital users according to the purpose to which they put technology.  Digital visitors see the digital landscape as a tool, and enter for specific purposes (i.e. communication, networking, research); digital residents see digital technology as an integral part of their life.\\n  Based on my cumulative experiences, this categorization is more consistent with what I\\'ve observed.  I have not seen evidence that my students, or the younger generation, are thinking more quickly or more efficiently, which Prensky implies in describing their thinking as “faster [and] less step-by step [sic]” (p. 4).   However, I do see that a section of the population immerses themselves in a digital landscape in a way that I do not (the digital visitor). \\n  As a teacher, it is my duty to allow students to access information however they can, to the best of their abilities, and without compromising their ability to adapt.  This is particularly important considering that we are preparing students for jobs that do not even exist.  To do this students must learn to be critical and open-minded; they must see that questions have multiple solutions, and that answers may be generated using multiple skills or tools.\\n  References\\nPrensky, M.

I may write 1 or 2 more but I thought I would share what I had with you so far.\\n  Summary\\n                 The School-to-Prison Pipeline, is the idea that schools are unable to meet all the needs of K-12 schooling. The 7th and final chapter explores the juvenile justice system and the rights that children should have when in this system. The creation of the juvenile justice system was designed to help children rather than to punish them for their crimes. However, the juvenile justice system not only is failing to help students reintegrating them into society, but treats children as criminals. Furthermore, children in the juvenile justice system will be arrested for softer crimes, not have the same rights when in the courts, and may end up in other institutions while waiting for trials (foster homes, detention facility).\\n                 The second issue discussed in this chapter is about the approaches that can be taken to keep students out of prison. With the zero-tolerance policy, teachers are using the police more often to control unwarented behavior. This has resulted in more arrests among youth. It is suggested that legislation should be implemented to avoid children being incarcerated for soft crimes. Another suggestion made is for legislation to be created to protect students who have disabilities from being sent through the juvenile system. The last area that needs addressing is the racial disparity in the Juvenile system. Statistics have shown that there is an increase Black and Hispanic students being sent to prison while there is a reduction of White students being sent through the juvenile justice system.\\n                 The most important thing that society can do to help children in the juvenile system is to provide education in these facilities. Without education, there is little chance that they will be properly treated. Unfortunately, education in the juvenile system is an area that needs great improvement as it is usually not given to children in the system. Furthermore, children that are put into adult prisons are even more likely to not become rehabilitated and educated. Lastly, children that have gone through the juvenile justice system have difficulty getting back into education.\\n                 The chapter concludes with the hope that children who have gone through the juvenile system will be able to have an education and become treated\\n    Discussion Questions\\n1) An argument can be made that the continuing usage of police officers in schools is harming students rather than protecting them. Is there any value in having police officers in schools?\\n  2) What can schools do (instead of going to the police) to help students with adolescent behaviour issues?\\n  3) In the Juvenile Justice System, children do not have the same rights as an adult (i.e. children do not have the right to a jury trial). How do you think the juvenile justice system should change in order to ensure the equity of children detainees?\\n  4) Most correctional facilities for youth do not provide a form of education even though children in the juvenile justice system have the right to have one. What can be done to ensure that all correctional facilities have an education system in place and enforced?\\n  5) What can the system do to help children reintegrate into society and help get a proper education?\\n  6)  What do you think can be done to reduce/eliminate the racial disparity for children in the juvenile justice system?,\\n8,693,1,,\\n8,694,1,I know we (Canada) have problems, but I found this to be truly absolutely nuts:\\n  http://www.bet.com/news/national/2012/08/16/doj-says-mississippi-operating-school-to-prison-pipeline.html\\n    Ever thought you\\'d see the day that passing gas in class could land a child in jail? \\n  Well it’s here — at least it is in Meridian, Mississippi, claims the Department of Justice. A DOJ report issued last week explicitly calls Meridian’s rampant incarceration of school children a school-to-prison pipeline and demands the municipality stop the practice or face a lawsuit. \\n  The findings implicate the Lauderdale County Youth Court, the Meridian Police Department (MPD) and the Mississippi Division of Youth Services (DYS) for perpetuating the systematic arrests. According to the DOJ, these entities have violated the constitutional due process rights of juveniles with their policy of arresting all suspended students, without regard to the type of offense. Students have been routinely placed in a juvenile prison for minor infractions such as dress code violations, flatulence, profanity and disrespect.\\n  “The systematic disregard for children’s basic constitutional rights by agencies with a duty to protect and serve these children betrays the public trust,” Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “We hope to resolve the concerns outlined in our findings in a collaborative fashion, but we will not hesitate to take appropriate legal action if necessary.”\\n  Looking at the demographics of Meridian, it becomes clear who this policy affects most. Sixty-two percent of the overall population is Black and 82 percent of school district’s children are Black.\\n  The MPD\\'s policy is to automatically arrests all students referred by the school district without any further inquiry. This broad oversight allows officers to skirt the procedure of obtaining prior youth court custody orders or make assessments of probable cause.\\n  The DOJ has offered to negotiate with the parties, but if an agreement is not reached, Meridian will be forced to defend its policies in court. \\n   ,\\n8,695,3,Hello group!\\n  If you have had time to read the chapter, you will have noticed that it has nothing to do with Canada (directly).

It resulted in a \"zero tolerance\" approach to bad behaviour. In 2002-03, the number of students suspended in Ontario spiked to 157,436 – an increase of almost 50,000 from two years earlier. Almost one in five of those suspended was identified as having a learning disability or special need. The number expelled shot up to 1,786 from 106 in 2000-01.”\\nThe \"Roots of Youth Crime\" report to the provincial government last fall argued that zero tolerance \"increased the criminalization of marginalized youth.\" Critics argued it was targeting low-income and racial minority pupils, particularly blacks. Parents turned to the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which filed a discrimination complaint against the Ministry of Education and the Toronto board.\\nThe Liberal government responded with Bill 212. It gave school boards $44 million to set up alternative programs for suspended and expelled students and to hire 170 psychologists and social workers. Wynne describes the reform as an \"attempt to put a greater safety net around kids who are at risk.\"\\nThe bill pressured school boards to reduce suspensions and expulsions. Principals must consider whether mitigating circumstances, such as a learning disability, racism or bullying, led to unacceptable behaviour. (Suspensions are triggered automatically for having weapons, drugs or alcohol on school property, or for bullying.)\"\\n ,\\n8,700,1,Chapter 1\\nWhat were your initial impressions when reading this chapter?

It reminds me of the phrase that Wesley pointed out: \"You find crime where you police.\" (or something along those lines)\\nMy friend also mentioned how detrimental it can be for a young person to be convicted and sent to prison. In many of her experiences, she says that no \"correction\" occurs - that the time spent in prison actually does little to \"rehabilitate\" the individual and that it only perpetuates the problem. When prisoned youth are released, they find it increasingly difficult to obtain work and to reintegrate into school.\\nShe did however mention that on a positive note, she has seen a small shift in the judicial system when dealing with youth. Restorative justice practices and mentoring programs have become more common and I believe that these resolutions can lead to a positive outcome for troubled youths.\\n  We\\'ll discuss more tomorrow.\\nThanks\\n ,\\n8,702,1,  Cancer Journals - Audre Lorde\\n  Victim No More - Ellen Faulkner, Gayle MacDonald,\\n8,703,2,  Hi Jim,\\n  It took me a while to revise the first few chapters and to formulate interview questions.

Homeschooling their children away from formal institutions such as a public or private school is a right that parents are given.  However, this right is not available to parents all around the world.  While in Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand (which are fairly progressive when it comes to homeschooling policies and programming) homeschooling is completely legal, there are countries where it is completely illegal, under certain special exceptions, such as Sweden, Spain, and Greece.  Even more extreme is in Germany, where the practice it completely outlawed!\\n    Motivation by parents in Canada stem mostly from achievement rather than avoidance.  A 2003 Pan-Canadian study on homeschooling in Canada, in which 1,648 English and French speaking families replied to a questionnaire, found that reasons for homeschooling were based on a combination of moral, social, familial, and academic goals.  Negative aspects based on avoidance of private/public education included issues on safety, being a big waste of time, and lack of discipline.\\n\\nParental Procedures and Resources\\n    Legally speaking, the Education Act 21(1) requires that every child between the ages of six to sixteen to attend school, but in subsection 21(2), it lists legal reasons for that a child may be excused from attending school, one being if the child is receiving adequate instruction from home, or elsewhere.  Policy/Program Memorandum 131 provides parents and school boards with direction concerning policies relating to homeschooling.  First, a parent must notify the school board that they are with of their intent to homeschool their children in the sample letter provided below in Appendix B of PPM 131.  In it, parents are only required to give their child’s name, age, sex, mailing address, telephone number, and that they wish to homeschool their child(ren).  No list of lesson plans, curriculum they will be following, sample student work, etc. are required as a letter of intent is seen as grounds enough to assume a child will be receiving an adequate education.  This letter must be filled out every year before September 1st that the child is being homeschooled.\\n    Within the PPM 131 guidelines, parents are made aware of the fact that they may have access to EQAO/OSSLT testing, as well as access to the Ministry of Education curriculum documents, but neither is necessary to use or take.  All universities in Ontario have a home school admittance policy (except for Queens University in Kingston), so it is not required for a homeschooled child to receive an Ontario Secondary School DIploma (OSSD).  Resources and support for homeschooling parents are available through the Ontario Federation of Teaching Parents (OFTP), Ontario Christian Home Educators Connection (OCHEC), and much more.  The community is strong, and growing every year!\\n\\nProcedures to be taken by the school/school board\\n1) The child will be removed from attendance documentation, as the child is excused from attending school (subsection 21(2), clause (a) of the Ed. Act)\\n2) Send to the home a letter confirming in writing the intent, names, ages and genders of the children being homeschooled, as well as giving parents information as to how they may access EQAO and OSLT testing.(See PPM 131 and Appendices B,C,D)\\n3) The School Board - Will review the exclusion and if necessary begin the proceedings to conduct a review.\\n\\nInquiry/Investigation\\nOnly occurs when there is evidence, or a claim of:\\nrefusal of a parent to notify the board in writing of the intent to provide home schooling\\na credible report of concern by a third party with respect to the instruction being provided in the home\\nevidence that the child was removed from attendance at school because of ongoing conflicts with the school, not for the purpose of home schooling\\na history of absenteeism by the child prior to the parent\\'s notifying the board of the intent to provide home schooling\\n  Legal Ramifications\\nWhat choices will you make...\\n\\nas a parent - Will you homeschool your kids?  What if your partner wants to?  \\nas a principal - How do you deal with accusations or rumours of inadequate education?  How will you handle an investigation into homeschooling?\\nas a teacher - Does homeschooling invalidate what we do?  Should homeschooling parents have a teacher qualification?  Should homeschooling for “personal” reasons (rather than medical or safety) be outlawed?\\n  Food for Thought\\n\\nIs homeschooling only for the wealthy?\\nDo homeschooled kids lack socialization skills?\\nDo homeschooled kids do better or worse academically?\\nCan or does homeschooling affect the quality of our public education system?\\n  Resources\\n\\nPPM 131: http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/extra/eng/ppm/131.html\\nAppendices (forms etc.): http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/extra/eng/ppm/ppm131.pdf\\nHome Education in Canada: a Summary of the Pan-Canadian Study on Home Education in 2003: http://www.hslda.ca/assets/pdf/summary-final.pdf\\nOntario Federation of Teaching Parents (OFTP): http://ontariohomeschool.org\\nOntario Chirsitan Home Educators’ Connection (OCHEC): http://www.ochec.org/\\nCatholic Homeschoolers Association in Ontario: http://hscatholics.tripod.com/id2.html\\n\\nCases cited:\\nR.F. vs. M.G.B., BC - custody dispute: http://canlii.ca/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2012/2012bcsc1211/2012bcsc1211.html\\nLong vs. Los Angeles County - temporary ban of homeschooling: http://www.wnd.com/2008/03/58872/\\nQuebec case - socialization in daycare of 3-year-old: http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/quebec-judge-orders-three-year-old-into-daycare-for-socialization/\\nNH, 2009-2011 - religious Janey\\nRuling 2009: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/04/home-schooled-christian-girl-ordered-to-join-publi/?page=all\\nUpholding 2011: http://www.christianpost.com/news/nh-court-upholds-order-to-send-homeschooled-girl-to-public-school-49468/,\\n8,727,2,In the interest of saving papper - here is our digital handout for today\\'s presentation about Oppositional Defiant Disorder\\nEnjoy!!\\n\\nShira, Alicia, Heather, Michelle, Lorne,\\n8,728,1,Here is our ODD presentation from today! ,\\n8,729,2,Yeah, personally my style is to just grab the free tools and if I don\\'t like their templates just come up with my own lessons from scratch...

Thanks\\n ,\\n8,744,1,Summary/Response:\\n  I felt challenged by this article, and the following interpretations, messy and partial, are themselves open to interpretation and challenge:\\n  In \"White Is a Color!\", Roman addresses the discourse of \\'white-defensesivenss\\', a position based on relativism that fails to acknowledge and address the systemic and material realities of disadvantage that can belie multicultural or pluralistic \\'solutions\\' to inequality. We must, she says, move away from an essentialist view of race to focus on the \"unequal effects of racism\".  In other words, it\\'s not enough to say, in Roman\\'s opinion, to \\'celebrate difference\\' in our classes. Whites claiming to suffer racism or that \\'everyone suffers oppression\\' can \"bypass power as well as history to suggest a harmonious empty pluralism\". In other words,  muticultural, relativist and pluralistic discourses \\'cover up\\' the fact that real inequality exists, and that whites are conferred upon a position of priviedge which they/we benefit from.\\n  Roma brings feminism into the discussion and I don\\'t fully understand her meaning here. I think that she\\'s saying a similar thing happens within feminist discourses; by focusing on injustice that happens to \\'us\\', we ignore/subsume voices of those who experience injustice beyond our personal experience (ie. non-white, poor, non-western women).\\n  Those in positions of priviledge, Roman argues, label voices which call attention to inequality as  \\'extremist\\', and therefore demand the ignoring of these voices. She writes \"When educators assert or protect relativistic claims in the classroom, what emerges is an implicit endorsement, in not advocacy, of the existing social inequality\". It is not until we move to the \"hard work of coalition politics\" that we can begin to do the work of social justice and equity. \\n  This all has major implications for educators, of course. In practical terms, Roman suggests that white students and teachers need to take a close look at their/our place of privilidge and their part in the narratives of racism. This is done through critical analysis of how their/our own racial interests function, and how \" the injustices they reap for others would necessarily become the objects of analyses of structural racism\".\\n    Questions:\\n  - As a teacher, would you bring issues of race into your classroom? If so, to what end? What challenges do you foresee in doing so?\\n  - Would your positioning of issues of race or class differ if you were teaching predominately priviledged students versus predominately marginalized students? If so, how?\\n  - Is empathy a concept that is relevant to Roman\\'s argument? What does it mean to be empathetic regarding people\\'s experience of disadvantage or discrimination?\\n  - What does it mean to be an oppressor?\\n  I know these are difficult questions; I hope they are valuable in some way. Looking forward to our discussion on Monday.\\n  Aaron,\\n8,745,1,I have a number of American friends and that\\'s who I\\'ve seen it from - the original caption on this indicated it was an ad campaign in Ohio I believe; however, I\\'ve seen in circulating from different friend groups lately (both American; one in Michigan, another in Colorado),\\n8,746,6,There\\'s a lot going on in this article, so if you didn\\'t get to it, I\\'ll take a leaf from Emilie\\'s book and strongly encourage you to read the summaries of other groups to get other perspectives.\\n  Summary\\nRoman’s article challenges a prominent relativistic stance in anti-racist pedagogy in her time, and avers that much of the vocabulary, dialect, and dialogue around anti-racism is both reductionist and ultimately supportive of oppression. \\n  First, it is important to situate Roman’s article historically.  Written and published between 1991-1993, she mentions at one point the “current national backlash against gains made [in] social justice” (p.73).  In the United States, this is a time of the 1987 stock market crash and the ensuing recession; George Bush and the Gulf War; the L.A. police beating of Rodney King  (a black man) and ensuing riots that killed 58 people; the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and several national controversies on corporal punishment in the justice system.  This was a time when the USA visibly warred between liberal social justice activism and neoliberal/conservative regressions.    \\n  In this context, it is important to ask how this affects her opinions.  Roman writes as a white, middle-class, Jewish, feminist, and the article is directed at those on a similar plateau of privilege.  She begins with a short discourse on the phrase “people of color”, deeming it a problematic term that actually subordinates those whom it attempts to empower, and that it ultimately relieves whites of the responsibility to challenge racism.  She then challenges the relativistic discourse around anti-racism – essentially that all sides have stories and all stories are equal, therefore we can all depart from the common ground of The Oppressed – and calls this (not in her words) a copout.  This is a privileged stance, Roman says, only afforded and used by those who use acknowledgement of privilege as a cover, and who, if they do not move from realization to acknowledgement to activism, further entrench race in a position of subordination.  There is complicity and ease in acknowledging complicity.\\n  “Homeless people cannot eat discourse (p. 77): Talking cannot do anything without action, and self-realization and confession of inherent privileges does not change the racist, often unwittingly internalized status quo.  Roman, in fact, groups “diversity” and “multiculturalism” with “race” as vocabulary that tacitly subordinates the racialized groups, and states that race must be problematized as well as acknowledged.  She offers an alternative to the study of racism, a dialogue where those not considered “oppressed” (in whatever discriminatory setting) need to “speak with” rather than “speak for/instead”.  Innate to this new dialogue is a critical engagement of one’s place within discourse.\\n  Questions\\n“Whites are oppressed.”  Is this news to you?  Do we (and I do mean, we specifically, not we in general) actually unknowingly perpetuate the dominance of men/whites/heterosexuals in the language we use?  (Related question: You have a class of 4 whites, 5 black, and 1 Asian.  Who is in the minority?)\\nSelf-examination time!\\n“What are the moral and political consequences of a teacher …. failing to challenge the epistemic standpoints of white students claiming to be oppressed on racial grounds?  Can teachers avoid the…impositions of our own critiques as master-narratives of authority upon what counts as the real in the service of radical social change?”\\nRoman’s criticisms of relativism come very close to negating much of our learning at OISE.  We have been doing much reflection about relative sides of the story, and understanding different perspectives, but to Roman this is merely an example of, essentially, cowardly relativism and not of critical realism.  Are we taking the easy way out, at OISE, in schools, or in general?  Why or why not?\\n“Homeless people cannot eat discourse.”  What is your reaction to this statement, and its implications? In that context, what do you think of Roman’s new paradigm, speaking with instead of speaking for/instead?\\nWe have discussed labels a lot in other classes – exceptionalities, races, cultures – and debated the usefulness of such labels.  Is “Jewish”, for instance, a race?  Ethnicity?  Nation?  Does it matter?  And ultimately, do these labels balkanize peoples, or do they serve a productive purpose in identification followed by unity?\\nThink about some of the things we see and hear on the news: gender/age (cyber) bullying, Romney’s binders full of women, the election and possible re-election of Barack Obama, Omar Khadr, numerous Toronto shootings.  In this context, is Roman’s anti-relativism argument relevant?  Necessary?  Outdated? ,\\n8,747,1,Thanks so much for taking the time to do this!,\\n8,748,1,  Conceptualizing Race & Culture Roman, L. G. (1993). White is a Color! White Defensiveness, Postmodernism, and Anti-Racist Pedagogy. In C. Mccarthy, Race, Identity and Representation in Education. New York: Routledge.\\nSummary:\\nThis is a complicated article to summarize, particularly in a short space. I am going to attempt to outline major themes and ideas. Please also read the summaries and questions posed by our peers; because they may have had a different perspective.\\n  For Roman, “White is a Color” addresses a central contradiction within contemporary social studies. Similarly, the phrase, “people of colour” developed as a positive achievement of multiculturalism, and an alternative to more negative “racial” distinctions. However, Roman argues that it conveys the mistaken idea that racially subordinate groups are essential subjects of a single experience or system of racism.\\n  Roman speaks from a postcolonial feminist perspective. Postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge to some of the organizing premises of Western Feminist thought. Feminist movements and theoretical developments were predominantly led by middle-class white women, and marginalized others. Postcolonial feminists, proposed alternative theoretical frameworks. Similarly, the multiculturalist ideology of difference as pluralism raises questions concerning what post colonial feminist critic Mohanty calls “a hastily derived notion of ‘universal sisterhood.’”  \\n  Roman contends that this tendency to treat race as a universal or concrete experience for all racially subordinate groups, contributes to white misrecognition of the effects of their own racially privileged locations. Roman argues that these stable categories must be challenged, by asking how race operates in a daily practice as a set of complex meanings, we move toward understanding how there are unequal effects of racism for different groups of people.  \\n  Roman also critiques the “politics of voice” or the crisis of “speaking for” others. Post modern skepticism as to whether anyone has or ought to have the authority to speak in the name of social change, to Roman is not altogether misguided. Roman proposes the provisional alternative of, “speaking with rather than for, the interests of oppressed groups who are engaged in critically evaluating and transforming existing social relations.” Although she is unable to define the politics of “speaking with” in any absolute way, she cites the relational politics of dialogue, between unequally located groups.\\n  Questions:\\nI would like to discuss some of the questions that Roman poses on page 81. \\nRoman gives an example from her own experience and asks: How does she, a middle class, white, feminist teacher respond to or evaluate the claim made by a white, middle class student that she had been the subject of racial discrimination simply because she was outnumbered by the African American students in the class?\\n*How broadly can the categories of difference and oppression be drawn and who gets to draw them?\\n*Can teachers avoid the worst fears of postmodernists, that is imposing our own critiques as master narratives upon what counts in the service of radical and social change? (E.g. are we likely to speak FOR instead of WITH diverse racial groupings in which we do not belong?)\\n  And if so, how do we bring issues of race into the classroom?\\n  If we are teaching in a class that does not represent the diversity/multiculturalism of the society in which we live, and therefore can not engage in dialogue with students who have had different experiences, how do you speak “with”, instead of “for”?\\n  How does our language/terminology make the assumption that subordinate races have the same experience? What other ways do we group and make assumptions about students based on their experiences? (Disadvantaged vrs. Advantaged students?)\\n  Castenell, L. A., & Pinar, W. (New York). Understanding Curriculum as Racial Text: Representations of Identify and Difference in Education. 1993: SUNY Press.\\n  Summary:\\nRace is one of the categories that order our worlds. This book is dedicated to examining these categories as functions of the curriculum.\\n“We speculate about their (categories) relationship to the world they name; we investigate the social processes that have constructed them and identify their presence in curriculum where they recapitulate and renew the common order.”\\n  In my summary I use the term Blacks because that is the term Whatley uses.\\nChapter Four:\\nPhotographic Images of Blacks in Sexuality Texts\\nMariamne H. Whatley\\n              Whatley examined sixteen college level texts, published from 1980-1987, to see how Blacks were presented in photographs. Photographs have more impact than a drawing because it is seen as an objective representation of reality. Whatley found a problematic pattern to the photos where Blacks appeared. She grouped these into the following recurrent themes: Blacks as “exotics,” Blacks as “sexually dangerous,” Blacks as asexual, and Blacks and paternal responsibility. She feels it is essential to examine the curricular materials, since textbook publishers define their market as the teacher or the professor, not the student. Therefore there is some potential for faculty to exert economic, as well as critical pressure to promote change. Whatley argues there have been significant gains in the surface messages presented on gender and race issues, however covert messages in many forms contradict this intent. Whatley argues, with her theoretical background, that photographs in texts are chosen, composed, constructed, objective and don’t reflect reality. Researcher Barthes argues that the captions also become as “real” and “objective” as the photograph itself is believed to be. Photographs can carry messages, intentional or not, never stated in the text. In examining texts the power of photographs should never be underestimated.\\n            There is a great diversity of whites in sexuality texts therefore they may be seen as individuals or a part of a particular subgroup, such as teenagers or transsexuals, rather than representative of the entire white population. However, since so few images of cultural and racial minorities appear, each representation bears more weight.  Unless one consciously works against this, the representations of nondominant groups in the media can be used as a way to perpetuate the myth of inferiority, reinforce stereotypes and maintain the status quo.  She argues that textbook authors and editors tend to be “liberal” in their representations of race and culture. The difficulty may come in identifying subtle ways in which the most well intended text becomes subverted by the images presented.\\nExamples from the text:\\nBlacks as exotic: pictures from around the world highlighting difference. E.g. Trobraind Island girls from New Guinea sing bawdy songs and dance to attract boys. Is this really that different from a North American bar scene or high school dance?\\n  Blacks as sexually dangerous: E.g. In all four cases that pimps were featured they were black.\\n  Blacks as asexual and Blacks and paternal responsibility: Presentation may be a conscious attempt to counter myths.\\n  Questions:\\nEducational texts are a multi-million dollar industry. How much change could we promote by choosing not to use certain texts for political reasons?\\nHow will you choose your curricular materials/text?\\nHow much freedom do you think you will have?\\nWhatley says textbooks are not objective and factual but instead are social products, if we accept this, how do we foster critical thinking in our students around these texts?\\n       ,\\n8,749,2,This is a scanned document of chapter 1 for one of the readings on Oct. 22.

Prior to the 1960s, African American studies existed as an area of inquiry, but it only achieved the status of a discipline when black scholars started gaining positions of power within academic institutions and were able to certify knowledge. Yet this situation presents a challenge to the discipline.\\nThe need to protect itself as a discipline within predominantly white institution has forced black scholars to adopt notions of unity and uniformity at the expense of diversity and rich dialogue. The diversity in the African American experience is therefore not properly represented in the academic discipline for the sake of maintaining the academic standards that give the discipline its legitimacy. The discipline faces the challenge of attracting the visionary minds who will challenge and transform those standards or it risks being destroyed from within.\\n\\nRace and class are the major competing theoretical lenses that frame the discourse within the discipline. The author argues that rather than competition, scholars should realize that neither lens is complete enough to explain all aspects of the black experience, and that the discipline would benefit from the addition of gender as a third paradigm within the discipline. We must recognize that black intellectual women’s thought has been silenced by the dominant male perspective of what constitutes intellectualism. Black feminist scholars have faced pressure to apply race as main paradigm of their studies. For example, during the 1970s and 1980s they have often found it easier to examine racism within predominantly white feminist organization than to examine sexism within black organizations.\\n\\nThe author concludes that the future of African American studies depends on its ability to break the silence on gender issues; recognize that gender, race, and class are not mutually exclusive paradigms; and maintain an inclusive intellectual community that will attract and retain women.\\n\\nWhite Is Colour!\\n\\nWhite is also a colour! Institutionalized whiteness puts whites in a position of power  Current notions of multiculturalism are fake. We are asked to celebrate diversity without acknowledging white privilege, implying that whites are free from the responsibility to challenge racism. \\n\\nRelativism means acknowledging all knowledge as equally valid, and therefore teachers who endorse relativistic claims indirectly endorse existing social inequities. Educators need to reframe curriculum as a dialogue and democratize knowledge and construction of theory. We cannot separate the knowledge from the interest group that it represents.\\n\\nThrough such critical lens white students could learn to recognize that racism is not only an individual expression of prejudice, but it also exists at a deeper systemic level that privileges the white. \\n\\n\\nWould you bring issues of gender discrimination within an oppressed culture into the classroom? How could you do so without further reinforcing white privilege or seeming to attack the oppressed culture? \\nIs the education system moving in the right direction? The the ministry and school boards’ are emphasising inclusive education, knowledge construction through dialogue, and critical literacy. Is this a real shift towards challenging existing power structures or just another example of relativism? \\nThe concept of racism is often taught to young children in its simplistic form of individual expressions of prejudice. What is an appropriate age for students to tackle the deeper layers of institutionalized racism? What are the risks to teachers, who are part of the institution, in adopting such critical stance?,\\n8,751,2,This relates to our discussions of equity, discrimination and privilege, among other things.

I highly recommend looking over other group summaries in order to fully grasp major themes in this week’s readings, as we will not be able to cover all issues in our short discussion:\\n  Summary\\n              The concept of ‘race’ inadvertently (or perhaps not, by groups of privilege) acts to further differentiate between the ‘self’ and ‘other’.  However, the idea of race, which defines who the “people of colour”, “other”, or “racially subordinate” are, changes in different political times and points in history.  Issues of who is considered “white” also change with time.  “Whites” become “those who are the privileged or dominant ones”.  Identity is also constantly changing, because it too is a construct of history, gender, and race.\\n            Humans create curriculum, as a discursive formation of identity and difference, which in effect becomes reality, or human reality.  Curriculum is in affect a representation of how we wish to identify ourselves to our children.  In other words, what we teach our children in school determines what we think we are, and what they might one day become.  It outlines what it means to be “American” or “Canadian”, or of a certain gender, or race.  Therefore, if through curriculum we identify ourselves, it directly becomes a racial text, a political text, a gender text, etc. \\n            There is a saying that goes “we are what we know”, but is it not also true that “we are what we do not know”?  If what we know about ourselves culturally, historically, and nationally is skewed by “absences, incompleteness, and denials”, then our identity is also fractured.  So, a curriculum with a Eurocentric view, for example, does not only deny non-Europeans knowledge about themselves, but it also denies “whites” self-understanding.  The “American” or “Canadian” self becomes repressed because the whole story is not being told.  The ‘people’ who built the country should be acknowledged for their hard work, and be part of it’s identity as self.  Institutional racism comes in through curriculum when it does not represent the lived experiences of non-European students.\\n            Because curriculum is a racial text, issues of racism must be brought up in the classroom.  In order to not dig the “racially subordinate” deeper into sub ordinance, it must be known to students that the idea of ‘race’ privileges “whites”, and that celebrating multicultural backgrounds within the classroom is not enough.

Would you even know how to, or want to, conduct such critical analysis of the deeper systemic issues of racism?\\n  2) By 2050, it is projected that minority groups will become the majority, at least in the United States, as outlined in the readings.  What affect, if any, may this have on national identity and specifically on the idea of “white” and “other”?\\n  3) How does the Ontario Curriculum identify who we are as Canadians, nationally and racially, to our children?\\n  4) Because curriculum is a racial text, and will always be one, are we, as Canadians, presenting a story that is representative of our true identity, even though it may not be as European as we may think?  Is the fact that curriculum is a racial text, or political text etc. necessarily a bad thing?,\\n8,755,1,Hello Everyone (Please pass this message to Emma)\\n  I hope everyone had a good Friday and Saturday.

White Defensiveness, Postmodernism and Anti-Racist Pedagogy\\nBy: Leslie G. Roman\\n  Summary: \\n  Roman offers an interesting perspective on the philosophical underpinnings of feminist interpretations of whiteness and racism. She argues that, the idea of harmonious diversity is euphemistic, claiming, as Linda Alcoff also argues, that speaking or advocating on behalf of the \"voiceless\" or oppressed is essentially a reiteration of privilege. Indeed, advocating for the \"other\" is further silencing those that are spoken for. Moreover, Roman provides an overview of feminist advocacy, and then posits a progressive, materialist and anti-racist pedagogy. She argues that the classroom needs to act as an oppourtunity for those who are oppressed to engage in dialogical discourse with those who are situated within privilege. This discourse removes a teacher-enforced master narrative and allows for a mutually constructed and socially contested realism to exist. In effect, This dialogue will democratize production of theory, or more simply, allow race theory to be critiqued through those living within the experience of the classroom or institutionalized privilege. Further, Roman proposed that this method of dialogue will move the conversation from \"white-defensiveness\" to \"appropriate speech where we/they take effective responsibility and action for disinvestigating racial privilege\". \\n  Questions: \\n  1. Within the context of last weeks discussion, as raised by Tanya\\'s point, where we discussed a desire to move beyond difference to a kind of reality where \"non-racism\" exists  - do you think that Roman\\'s propsed pedogogy is enough? Does it problematize inclusivity because it undermines the idea of multicultural or diverse harmony?\\n  2. Does Roman\\'s \"theoretical plan\" seem plausible in a middle school context OR What challenges might by met by developing this kind of dialogic discourse?\\n  3. At Voice School, I was struck by how deeply students engaged with the content I provided, but realized that there is an inherent vulnerability to the act of sharing oppression - how can we develop a method to ensure students feel safe within a highly emotionally charged classroom context?\\n    Canonical Sins \\nBy: Peter M. Taubman\\n  Summary: \\n  Taubman uses a psychoanalytic perspective on literature, as well as the concept of the literary canon to depict the binary of \"sameness\", as explained by the canon, and \"otherness, as shown through the oppositional discourse. He argues that both groups, ultimately, employ the same strategies to defend and destroy (or shift) the status quo. Taubman articulates that neither disrupt the system in a meaninful way, and simply reappropriate the idols and privilege different texts. He posits that within classrooms we need to allow students to develop their own meaning from within the texts, rather than furthering master narratives. \\n  Questions: \\n  1. Is the curriculum, essentially, a master-narrative?\\n  2. Do the students require different tools of discourse to engage meaningfully with texts?\\n  3. Does this notion of canonical texts reinforce or alter your perception of literature you appreciate? OR Do you think it will affect the way you look at your literacy program?,\\n8,759,1,Please find attached.,\\n8,760,1,This is the consent form found at the bottom of Angie Potts\\' MTRP, separated for your convenience.

Despite the new developments, the policies regarding technology use haven’t really changed much so let’s look at those first. The board provides five guiding principles for appropriate technology use:\\n1.       Technology should support teaching and learning, and enable efficient administration and communication throughout the board.\\n2.       Reasonable precautions should be taken to ensure the data being used is kept safe and secure.\\n3.       Resources are limited and should not be used wastefully.\\n4.       Technology users should operate within federal and provincial laws, as well as board policies and procedures.\\n5.       Any data stored on board technology is owned and may be accessed by the board. There should be no expectation of privacy.\\n  The school itself had it’s own policies which seemed to abide by the above guidelines:\\n1.       No improper/unethical use of technology (computer hacking, cyber-bullying).\\n2.       Cell Phones may not be used for any communication or for taking photographs unless granted permission by a school official.\\n3.       No posting photographs or images on the Internet without adult permission.\\n  Now let’s look at the changes and initiatives. The board recognizes that students want to take technology they use on a day-to-day basis and integrate it with how they learn at school. So in an effort to accommodate the needs of their students and promote the 21st Century Skills, the PDSB has implemented a new initiative called the LITP (Learning and Instructional Technology Plan – see links below) as of March 27, 2012. In a nutshell, this plan, which includes the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy, seeks to install WiFi in every school (by the end of the 2012 – 2013 school year) in Peel and encourage students to bring their wireless devices (laptops, tablets, smart phones, iPods, and more) to class (but remember, using these technologies in the classroom must still follow the 5 guidelines since they’re accessing board owned internet services). Moreover, in the spirit of equitable technology access, more wireless devices will be purchased by each school to be available for their students.\\n  So why use wireless technologies? Wireless technology has been shown to improve research skills, student engagement and achievement. It also allows for teachers to be more creative and innovative with instruction, build on social responsibility and digital literacy, and even strengthen their connection with parents.\\n  I saw a lot of cell phones and iPods in my classroom because of the BYOD policy. It was great for the most part. Students used them effectively, and were able to take better quality notes than if forced to use paper and pen/pencil. There were a few problems though. Having a cell phone in class can be very distracting for a middle school student, especially one with ADHD, and actually diminish engagement with curricular content. As a result, student achievement would drop. It goes without saying that a teacher can’t monitor their students at all times. So students will text in class and take part in cyber-bullying in real time. This was an ongoing problem with one of my students.\\n  There are other problems exist at the board level. Not every school is able to get WiFi right away, and the main reason for this is actually funding, not installation time like the board states in their LITP document (see link below). I know this from personally speaking to some of the IT workers who came to my placement school to install the WiFi network there. They can get every school in Peel within a year but that wouldn’t happen because the board doesn’t have enough money to do so. Moreover, once the WiFi is installed, the coverage isn’t that great. The network cannot be accessed from all parts of the school, and thus it’s possible for multiple classes to be excluded from access to the WiFi network (as was the case in my practicum school!).\\n      Links\\nLITP - http://www.peelschools.org/aboutus/mvv/technologyvision/Documents/10.8-VisionforLearningandInstructionalTechnolgyPlan2.pdf\\nhttp://www.peelschools.org/aboutus/mvv/technologyvision/Pages/default.aspx\\nhttp://www.peelschools.org/trustees/boardhighlights/Pages/Article.aspx?art-id=54\\nSchool level policies - http://schools.peelschools.org/1375/Pages/codeofconduct.aspx\\n             ,\\n8,821,2,This lesson is intended for grade 8 students.

Are you suggesting we cut class, Limin? ,\\n8,824,3,    My placement this term took place in Fossil Hill Public School in the York Region District School Board. During my placement, I noticed technology being used throughout the school and I noticed that students were permitted more freedom with their technology than in my first placement, which also took place in a York Region Public School.\\n            The Board Policy #194.0 entitled “Appropriate Use of Technology”  states that the school board “understands the benefits that technology can bring to support its daily operating activities and student achievements.”  According to the policy, students are able to use technology, including social networking sites, as well as bring cell phones to school, as long as they are being used for curriculum purposes and are under supervision of the teacher.\\n            I believe that the Board policy on technology supports student learning. It indicates that teachers are responsible for “instructing and modeling for students the appropriate use of technology.” This is an important guideline for student learning. Instead of banning technology because of possible misuse, it asks the teachers to model appropriate use, which is beneficial for students, especially in the 21st century. The Board policy also indicates that teacher cell phone use in classrooms is for instructional purposes only. This statement suggests that teachers are allowed to bring cell phones to class. I think this is beneficial for student learning as well. There were a few times in my placement where I was able to take out my cell phone for instructional use, which aided the students. If the board banned cell phones altogether, there would have been a loss of many teachable moments.\\n            The York Region District School Board also sends out “Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement” forms for primary, junior, transition, and senior students. This form indicates that modern, responsive learning environments integrate technology seamlessly into all aspects of learning. Again, YRDSB acknowledges that technology enhances student learning. The form, however, suggests that the students must adhere to the school’s Code of Conduct, which may differ in opinion.\\n            The Fossil Hill school website indicates that the school policy on technology can be located in the agenda. The agenda states that computers and Internet can be used, but for curriculum purposes only. Unlike the board policy, which tells teachers that they can use social networking sites for curriculum purposes, the school policy states that social networking sites are not permitted.  I am unsure, however, if this is always the case, or if this is just a rule for the children and there is an exception if the teacher requires them to access social networking sites for class.  If there is no exception to this rule, then this may impede student learning as social networking sites can be engaging and educational if used in the correct way.\\n            My classroom teacher did not have strict guidelines on technology. There were no forms that were sent home indicating the rules for cell phones or Internet use in class. The relaxed attitude towards technology aided the use of student learning in this case, as the students were responsible enough to handle technology appropriately. If technology constantly became a distraction, then the relaxed attitudes may have been harmful and stricter measures would have to be put in place. \\n\\nLinks below: \\n\\n\\nhttp://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/a/depts/curriculum/AppropriateUseJunior.pdf\\n \\n\\nhttp://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/p&p/a/policy/194.pdf\\n\\nAttached to this note is a page from the agenda which explains computer usage policy. \\n ,\\n8,825,2,Still in practicum this week; hope everyone\\'s having a fine break!\\n  Here are some images that my students took...

With regard to cell phone use, the school exhibits a strict no cell phone policy. Cell phones, if brought to school, are to remain in lockers, and can only be used by middle school students if and when they go off campus at lunch for safety purposes. Aside from the obvious interference that cell phones would have in the class, I think there is the obvious underlying intention of remaining equitable among all students, given the diverse economic backgrounds that make up the Moraine Hills student population.\\n  Majority of classrooms are equipped with a SmartBoard, the benefits of which are inarguably plentiful. The SmartBoard bridges the gap between the technology that students today yearn for and the need for direct, effective teaching and learning.\\n  Most J/I teachers set up a class website, called a Moodle, to which students and parents can access anywhere, anytime. All homework, assignments and general information is reported on the Moodle, so that everyone is on the same page at all times. The Moodle serves as an excellent, comprehensive, user-friendly communication tool between teacher and student, student and parent, and teacher and parent. Since teachers can monitor Moodle usage, it also serves as an assessment tool to gauge how often students are utilizing the information that is being given to them online in order to help them and better their learning process. If well maintained, the Moodle can prove to be an excellent teaching tool to strengthen student learning and to alleviate any miscommunications between teachers, students and parents. \\nIt is YRDSB policy that every school has a technology lead teacher, one for primary and one for junior. The technology lead teacher is in charge of everything in the school that runs on technology, from SmartBoard support, to the school website, and everything in between.\\n  This year at Moraine Hills, administration chose to have an online sign up for student-led conferencing. This was able to save the school paper, and also save them the headache of arranging times with other teachers of the students who have siblings in the school.\\n  On the school website parents can sign up for regular school updates to be delivered electronically to them. Given the current situation with Teacher Labour Relations, this served as an effective tool to get information home and to maintain ongoing contact and communication with parents both quickly and efficiently.\\n  In the newsletter there is a section on Internet safely, outlining how students can be aware of unsolicited online messages or websites, and how to surf the net safely. This shows that the school is doing its part to make parents and students aware of the implications that come along with a connection to the Internet. The newsletter also provides information and a link to students and parents for online extra help and support for grade 7 and 8 students struggling in math. The benefit of this online resource is that often (given the demographics of the school) many students’ parents are not fluent enough in English to offer them assistance with schoolwork.\\n  Part of board policy, teachers send a form titled, Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement Junior Studies. This form outlines what the school means by “proper use” of technology, as well as its connections to the Board’s Safe Schools Policy as well as the Code of Conduct.\\nYRDSB has Policy #194.0, called Appropriate Use of Technology. This policy outlines the responsibilities on part of the students, the teachers, the principals, the superintendents, the managers and all general users including ITS (information technology services) with regards to appropriate, safe and educational use of technology. It defines terms and definitions of all things related to technology, so that every individual associated with the school is well informed and well aware of the responsibility and accountability that comes along with technology given the advances we are seeing and more common use in schools today.\\n    Link to YRDSB online form: http://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/a/depts/curriculum/AppropriateUseJunior.pdf\\n  Link to Policy #194.0: http://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/p&p/a/policy/194.pdf\\n  Link to Moraine Hills School website: http://www.morainehills.ps.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/\\n  Link to Moraine Hills Newsletter: http://www.morainehills.ps.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/newsletter/2012-2013/03nov.pdf\\n  Link to online extra help resource: https://homeworkhelp.ilc.org/about/index.php\\n  I have attached a longer version, with greater detail (my original assignment prior to realizing the 500 word limit) :)\\n     ,\\n8,828,2,Visual Arts Lesson Plan: Pointing Towards Home,\\n8,829,2,Hi guys,\\n  For our Edmodo presentation on Thursday, please bring your laptops.

Even the school website, itself, does not have any other documents pertaining to school tech policies, because the school policies are the board policies, to put it bluntly.  The only references to technology, as a school policy, came out of the agenda, from the “John G Althouse Code of Conduct”.  In there, one bullet point covers all technological issues: “A John G. Althouse student leaves cell phones, pagers, and other electronic equipment at home, because the school takes no responsibility if these items are lost or stolen”.  I will get back to this point later.\\n            All other technology queries can be attained from the TDSB’s “Code of Online Conduct”, which applies to students and employees using the board’s online systems and resources.  Students and employees (including teachers of course) sign a contract at the beginning of the year pertaining to this code of conduct.  In it, users are made aware of personal safety rules, unacceptable sites and materials, use guidelines, prohibited uses and activities, consequences, online publishing, and liability.\\n            A code of conduct this specific is necessary, especially when students are not allowed to bring personal devices to school, as well as using technology publicly funded by the TDSB.  This code has been constantly updated to suit the needs of the time, and cyber bullying seems to be a huge issue now more than ever.  The principal at John G. Althouse actually gave a talk on the first day of school regarding this.  The board code of online conduct echoes what she mentioned: never reveal personal information about yourself or someone else to strangers or in cases where this information can be used for harmful purposes, never use the system to threaten, intimidate, or discriminate against other people, never use inappropriate/abusive language or conduct, or violate the rights of any other person.\\n            Such a code, however, does not pertain to private/home systems and networks.  This is where the school’s code of conduct helps.  Students are expected to be respectful to one another, and to “treat others as they would want to be treated”.  These points may refer to issues regarding all aspects of life, including life online.\\n            There is no question that the board code of online conduct will only better student learning, but I am not sure if disallowing students to bring electronic devices to school necessarily will.   At first glance, it seems like this is a way for the school to avoid the issue altogether.  “If we do not allow personal devices to school, we will not have any issues with it”.  I think that as long as the students have adequate access to technology at school, not allowing students to bring electronic devices may be a viable option.  Personal devices may be a distraction after all.  In schools where access to technology may be limited, using every resource available to support learning, even devices students have at their own personal disposal, may be the best option in that instance.  This, however, was not the case at my practicum school, which had all the new gadgets we have been talking about in our tech class.  So, perhaps such an overarching rule is not all that bad here after all.\\n  Links:\\n1)   Toronto District School Board “Code of On-line Conduct”: http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/about_us/communications/docs/OCC.pdf\\n2)   John G.

I broke up my reflection throughout the lesson plan and wrote it in red next to each part of the lesson on which I was reflecting. I hope that\\'s okay. It all adds up to just over a page. \\n\\nLet me know if I\\'m missing anything.,\\n8,833,2,  For this term I was placed at John Wanless (J.W) Public School in the Toronto District School Board. J.W. is a K-6 school located in an affluent area of the city. J.W students have access to various technologies both at home and at school. Each classroom is equipped with a SmartBoard and the schools set of 30 netbooks and 20 iPads are available to teachers on a sign-out basis. The library contains 20 desktops that students can use during their library period (once a week) or by special request.\\n  Throughout my placement, discussion pertaining to the schools technology policies occurred once, when a student’s cell phone began ringing during a lesson. My AT asked the student to turn off the phone, and reminded the class about the rules pertaining to cell phone use. In the student agenda, a section titled, Cell Phones and Electronic Devices states “ all personal communication devices are to be powered off and stored out of view during instructional class” (p.13). Students at J.W, and in particular in my grade six class, abided by the technology policies. The above student’s embarrassed reaction along with the class’ response led me to believe that an incident like this is rare at J.W. I believe technologies can enhance student learning but if the above example was commonplace in a classroom, interruptions or distractions provoked by technologies could in fact impede student learning. Policies are definitely needed to monitor the use of technologies at school.\\n  Apart from student agendas, the only other mention of technology policies at J.W occurs at the beginning of the year when the TDSB’s Code of Online-Conduct form, is sent home for students and parents to read and sign. According to the form, TDSB understands that the “Internet is a rich source of information and [has] opportunities to enhance student learning. However, increased access to the Internet raises issues that must be addressed and understood ” (p.6).  Parents and students must sign the agreement, which states they have read the rules and understand that if a student breaks the rules “their computer access privileges may be suspended and that further disciplinary or appropriate legal action may be taken” (p.6). Apart from the two mentioned sources, technology related polices were neither visible nor mentioned in newsletters, school website, or elsewhere.\\n  I tried to incorporate technologies such as the SmartBoard, computers, and iPads in my lessons as best I could. I felt that students were able to bring their “digital native” skills to the subject content, which in turn increased their interest and helped consolidate their learning. Technology helped support learning as it allowed for students to demonstrate their knowledge in creative and diverse ways.  Students enhanced their research skills, and used multimedia presentations to supplement oral presentations and for some this increased their confidence as well. Incorporating technology in teaching at J.W is not strenuous nor time-consuming because polices are in place, and students abide by the rules.\\n  References\\n  TDSB John Wanless Public School 2012-2013 Agenda (see attachment for photo)\\nTDSB Operational Procedure PR571 Code of Online-Conduct, Reviewed October 2012: http://www.tdsb.on.ca/ppf/uploads/files/live/96/294.pdf\\n   ,\\n8,835,1,Hurray for science!,\\n8,836,1,  Policies for technology use by students and teachers are important for successful integration of technology in the classroom. The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) has many policies in place to ensure that all schools, principals and teachers that are “on board” in terms of the benefits of technology use in the classroom, have access to the tools that they need to implement technology use. For example, the YRDSB emphasizes the need for reliable hardware, and access to support services in the case of technical difficulties (Board, 2004), a value which I witnessed being upheld during my practicum.\\nRogers P.S. itself promotes the use of technology. While the school website has no explicit school policy regarding the importance of technology use in the classroom, the school speaks for itself. (York Region District School Board, 2012) Rogers P.S. is equipped with one “computer pod” that consists of 8 computers, two laptop carts equipped with 25 computers and 25 computers in the library. The classrooms share smartboards and projectors, among other types of technology, making it easy for teachers to integrate technology into student learning.\\nAccess to technology was obviously not an issue at Rogers, however responsible use was a problem that I encountered at this school and at previous practica. Rogers P.S. provided internet access to all devices through a Wifi network which made it very convenient for educators to integrate the internet into lessons and learning. Unfortunately, this access was also granted to students who took advantage of this freedom by accessing off-topic online content during class time. I witnessed numerous occasions of students playing online games, chatting and e-mailing on personal laptops during class time. Internet misuse during school hours is completely unacceptable, and according to a “technology user agreement” for Junior students, the board agrees with this. (York Region District School Board) This agreement – available on the school website - is a form to be signed by students and their parents, acknowledging that they agree to use their technology devices during school hours for educational purposes, and to maintain respect for the board and their school through their technology use.\\nI believe that the policies of the board - to allow, encourage and provide technology to students to improve student learning - help students learn to their best ability. I have seen cases of students who were able to grasp difficult concepts and students who were rendered more able to communicate through the use of technology. In this way, board policies supported students learning. Unfortunately, technology was also a distraction to students because of a failure to emphasize the importance of appropriate technology use during school hours. The future of the classroom will see more and more students bringing ministry-provided laptops and personal-use laptops into the class. Access, support and regulation for appropriate laptop use are important and need to be made a priority by the board for technology integration to work. However, once the technology is provided, the responsibility lies with teachers and principals to make appropriate use a reality. I look forward to continuing to get a broader sense in the future of what strategies and techniques teachers use to address this problem.\\n  Works Cited\\nBoard, Y. R. (2004, September 28).

I was aware of YRDSB Policy 194.0 - Appropriate use of Technology. I am pleased that the first sentence of this policy explains that the board recognizes the benefits of using technology to support student learning. It was evident that the use technology use was encouraged by the amount available in the school. My class shared a pod with 3 other classes. In this pod, there was a laptop cart with 25 netbooks, 3 projectors, 2 document cameras and 1 smart board. There were also around 20 desktop computers in the pod. I was fortunate to take advantage of this technology while teaching.\\n       \\nThe policy then outlines teacher responsibility, “the overall management of student use of computing and information technology facilities and resources within their assigned teaching areas or when acting in a supervisory role; and instructing and modeling for students the appropriate use of technology.” The teacher has a huge responsibility to supervise and model technology use. During my practicum, students in my class used netbooks to create Bitstrip comics and to access the Internet for research. I noticed my teacher model how to use bitstrips and tell students specific websites to use for research.\\n      \\n  Further, I set up an Edmodo group for my class. I modeled how to create an account and what kinds of messages students should post. We had a discussion about appropriate use of language on Edmodo and the students were very receptive. I used Edmodo to post daily homework, generate discussions about classroom concepts and communicate with students to clarify assignments. I found this tool effective as students were engaged in learning while at home. I often posted games related to science and math homework for students to play at home, which they enjoyed.\\n       \\nThe board policy states, “if using social networking tools, do so with the appropriate understandings of the effective educational use of these tools, avoiding any personal uses when engaging with students, parents and colleagues for professional purposes.”  I feel that I followed this policy as Edmodo was used for classroom discussion and learning.\\n\\n       \\nIn addition to the Board Policy 194.0, the 2012-2013 parent and student guide to the school year includes an Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement. “All students and their parents/guardians must sign a form to acknowledge they have read, understand and will support the requirements/ conditions/rules concerning the use of school/Board and personal technology as it supports learning.”\\n\\nSome of the items students are accountable when signing this policy include: following the Board’s Safe, Caring and Supportive Schools Policy and the school Code of Conduct, using technology responsibly for educational purposes as assigned by a teacher and treating all school technology with respect. I saw this upheld at Fossil Hill. However, I was surprised that as part of the agreement, it states students are accountable for keeping personal information private (e.g. not publishing photos, names, â€¨addresses or phone numbers on the Internet). It seems like it is against this York Region policy for students to have Facebook or be part of other social networking sites.\\n\\nAlthough the policy states that consequences for not following the rules range from withdrawal of privileges to suspension, I do not think this particular rule about personal information is enforced. A question I asked myself while learning about these policies is should a school board have control over what students do on the Internet outside of school?\\n  http://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/p&p/a/policy/194.pdf Policy 194 link\\n\\nhttp://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/w/community/GuideToThe2012-2013SchoolYearWeb.pdf Guide for Students and Parents to the 2012-2013 school year\\n     ,\\n8,838,1,This is my Art Lesson plan. In it, students will mimic Van Gough\\'s painting technique in \"Starry Night\" to express their personal opinions about the pro\\'s and con\\'s of space exploration. \\n  The lesson plan itself is long, because it should build on previous learnings of self-expression through art and things like line, shape, form and balance. Also, I found that students take at least two 45 minute periods to finish a painting. ,\\n8,839,1,                  This practicum, I had the opportunity to run several of my own projects, two of which were internet intensive. In the first, I had gifted grade 6 students research a country for the social studies trading partners component. In the second, I had grade 6/7 gifted students analyze different types of online media (and their associated revenue collection streams) and then create their own informative/persuasive websites. The projects were successful and safe overall, a fact I attribute primarily to my technical know-how.\\n                I had the opportunity to observe this same class in the first week of September. During this time, there was the inevitable logistical nightmare of completing paperwork – including the signing of a form explaining that the parents had read the “Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement” and “Safe, Caring, and Supportive Schools Policy”. In the case of junior and intermediate grades, the students had to sign the agreement as well. The latter document is the same for all students and essentially targets bullying behaviour and the associated flowchart of discipline.\\nThe former document is more interesting. There is a different form for each range of grades, and they are linked here: Primary, Junior, and Senior. Each progressively gives more freedom to students. The primary has a series of “promises” that the students will only do what the teacher asks of them. The other two agreements give students more leeway, as it is understood that they will be doing research which requires the freedom to explore many different sources. The most important points on the junior form, as they relate to safety, are not sharing one’s personal information and respecting others’ needs for privacy. This is certainly important, but if the purpose of this whole process is to avoid having security leaks and preventing damage to school technology (software and hardware) then it is severely lacking.\\nBefore beginning my two units, I set up a data projector and had students analyze what makes a good Google search result, and what makes a bad/suspicious one, as a class. I did the same for judging a website’s authenticity. Many of the students were not aware of these facts, which are necessary for developing an internet legitimacy “gut instinct”. I developed my own gut instinct via trial and error after years of internet surfing. It also helped that I was aware of the reasons that some sites should not be visited and some programs should not be downloaded: profit via some sneaky means of advertisement or hacking, or straight up maliciousness. I have fixed many computers, and whenever it has been a software problem, it has been due to indiscriminate internet-surfing habits.\\nMy theory is that students are not led to develop these instincts because the people teaching them do not possess them. Many people have not bothered to learn these things because they did not grow up with them. Thus, it would require that they invest significant time and efforts to understanding how things function online. Since this process will not occur on its own, teachers must be educated in this subject both in terms of actual subject content and on the importance of having this knowledge; it is only then that a significant portion of this next generation of connected citizens will be able to use their connectivity systems safely.\\n  (In case the hyperlinks don\\'t work, please see attached file),\\n8,840,4,My grade 4 students created amazing dioramas about a specific habitat. The art was integrated with science and they loved using different materials to build. The students were all very proud of their work - and so was I!\\n\\n ,\\n8,841,1,The TCDSB school at which I completed my most recent placement seemed to be in a transition in terms of its interpretation and implementation of the board policies around technology use in schools.  Though, according to TCDSB policy, the school has access to classroom technology and the backing of board policy to integrate technology in daily activities, I would say that it generally fails to do so.\\n  Though it had a principal who seemed very much in favor of realizing the board’s goals around what they call 21st century learning, little seemed to be happening in classrooms that would indicate those goals were being actively pursued. The reason for this, as far as I could tell, was that it is ultimately up to teachers to decide how technology would or would not be a part of classroom ife. In the case of this school, most teachers decided not to use technology.\\n  The teaching staff was somewhat polarized on the issue of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy which came into effect as of September 2012. The school’s principal, young and formerly an IT worker, valued technology and wanted it to play a significant role in the school\\'s classrooms. She faced resistance from (generally speaking) the more senior members of her teaching staff, who rolled their eyes at the policy and the school’s 2012 PD theme of ‘21st century learning. Instead of trying to force, by some decree of law, a shift i,\\n8,842,1,  My practicum took place in an elementary (K-5) school in the TDSB, and as such is governed by the TDSB’s Code of Online Conduct (linked below).  The Code is a guide outlining permissible and unacceptable behaviour while online on school grounds, and details the importance of guarding personal while accessing unsafe websites and posting information (personal or otherwise) on the internet.   However, the Code of Online Conduct is equally a legal document protecting the TDSB, not only specifying that the express educational tethering to the TDSB, but also exempting them from\\n  “warranties of any nature or kind, expressed or implied, regarding its online services or resources, the continued operation of these services, the equipment and facilities used and their capacities, or the suitability, operability and safety of any program or file posted on TDSB systems for any intended purpose.”\\n  This last has the particular effect of leaving technology usage across the city extremely diverse; at my practicum, it was present but largely inaccessible.  As such, technology was often an afterthought in both student and teacher use.  Student agendas included the TDSB’s code of online conduct but neither they nor parents were required to sign a code of online or technological conduct.  Technology was not a large part of the school’s culture – a scan of posters around the school revealed concerns for the environment, homophobia, racism, and bullying.  Only in the latter does technology appear as the occasional sidebar regarding cyber bullying; student learning around cyber bullying depended entirely on the teacher.  \\n  Student access to computers was realistically limited to weekly appearances in the library, which doubled as the computer lab, and where students were expected by October to have both their student number and password memorized.  Sharing of usernames and passwords was strictly forbidden, so those students who regularly forgot their login information (or who forget their agendas, where it is written down) shared computers with another student if the work was only research related.\\n  http://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=262&menuid=23189&pageid=20102\\n   ,\\n8,843,1,  My placement this term took place at Cosburn Middle School in the Toronto District School Board. Despite a commitment to expanding technology infrastructure and use in the board, my initial observation in my placements, which have all been with the TDSB, is that technology integration is not prioritized, particularly in comparison with other Ontario Boards. For example, unlike in the PDSB and the YRDSB cell phones or personal devices have not been permitted in any of my placement schools. At Cosburn cell phones were strictly prohibited for both teachers and students during class time. If you wanted to allow students to use their cell phones in class for educational purposes you needed to have your lesson approved by the principal beforehand. Teachers were also reminded at both staff meetings that I attended that personal cell phone use should never occur during school hours.  \\n            The TDSB is committed to increasing student access to technology and increasing the use of assistive technologies. The board believes that new technologies have the power to stimulate the development of intellectual skills, provide new and diverse educational opportunities, and prepare students for how they’ll use technology in their future careers. The TDSB Classroom Technology Migration Initiative (CTMI) establishes the framework for a supportable, advanced and secured on-line learning environment, with the overall goal of supporting student learning.\\n            Despite these advancements the TDSB’s vision for 2015: all TDSB sites wireless enabled, every classroom and every teacher will have access to a computer, every student will have access to an electronic learning environment and parents will have electronic access to teachers and information about their child and the school environment, seems conservative. The TDSB’s approach to technology is governed by the Code of Online conduct, which outlines permissible and unacceptable behavior. The board is cognizant and responsive to the risks of technology and seems dedicated to using technology to support student learning only, even if that limits the potential technology use in the school. There are increasing expectations for the integration of Information and Communications Technologies in the classroom. However, the TDSB recognizes that although the appropriate use of technology can enable powerful teaching practices, inappropriate use can cause system failure, and can impede teaching and learning.\\n            I have an interesting perspective on technology use at Cosburn, because my placement was in the library. My Associate Teacher said that there was a push for her to incorporate technology as part of the library program, however this was not evident in our programming. There was a library website with programs such as “story bird,” which was used, but it was not a consistent aspect of the program. However, the library was lucky enough to receive funding for twenty iPads, which will hopefully be utilized to enhance student learning. There was a computer lab across from the library that was used, by some teachers more than others. Ten teachers had their own class web sites. However, there didn’t seem to be any consistent technology initiatives across the school. It also didn’t appear to be the school priority. Technology was not mentioned at any of the school improvement meetings, in any of the school newsletters or on the school website. I would say this reflects the board’s policies. There is an overall push to incorporate more technology to enhance students learning, but both the school and the board has not yet succeeded at implementing and incorporating technology in a consistent and effective way to support student learning.\\n  Links:\\n  Cosburn School website:\\nhttp://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/cosburn/Home.aspx\\n  TDSB website:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/\\n  TDSB’s Code of Online Conduct:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=262&menuid=23189&pageid=20102\\n  Increasing technology in the TDSB:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/about_us/media_room/room.asp?show=allNews&view=detailed&self=34389\\n  TDSB: Our Technology Infrastructure\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=309&menuid=4374&pageid=3710\\n ,\\n8,844,1,    This is an introductory art lesson that starts to explore the big idea of perspective. Students will be shown a variety of art pieces and be asked to compare and contrast. Some art pieces will have an obvious light source and others will not. Then students will explore in groups how shadows change depending on where the light source is coming from with their own flashlights. Students will start by doing a warm-up drawing of a sphere with the light source coming from a direction of their choice. By the end of the lesson students will be asked to produce a piece that has a light source coming from four different directions. \\n*Lesson integrated with the grade seven science curriculum. \\nI apologize, I wasn\\'t able to embed student work, find it attached. ,\\n8,845,1,  I had the pleasure of teaching at Pierre Laporte Middle School for my third practicum. In terms of technology, Pierre Laporte was well equipped with SMARTBoards in most classrooms, a computer lab, a set of 25 laptops, digital projectors, soundboards with accompanying speakers and microphones, digital cameras, and one Promethean Board.\\n  The TDSB has a board-wide policy that addresses computer and internet use in schools by students and TDSB employees. The Code of Online Conduct outlines rules and guidelines for internet/computer use that focus on personal safety, unacceptable websites and materials, prohibited uses and activities, online publishing, consequences, and liabilities. The Code of Online Conduct also includes a template for a student declaration form that requires students and their parent/guardians to sign and agree to the rules of the policy.\\n  The TDSB’s Code of Conduct for students, staff, and school community members, outlines inappropriate uses of electronic communications/media. All intentional uses of technology and electronic communication mediums that “negatively impact on the well-being of another person and/or the learning environment” are considered harassment and punished accordingly.\\n  The policies at Pierre Laporte MS regarding the use of technology within the school incorporated and echoed the TDSB policies. All students were required to sign a “computer contract” during the first week of school. This contract outlined inappropriate uses of computers and internet access, guidelines for usage, and consequences for breaking the rules. These guidelines and consequences were also clearly outlined in the front pages of the Pierre Laporte student agenda.\\n  Students at Pierre Laportre were not permitted to carry personal electronic devices during school hours, with the exception of lunch time. Cell phones, mp3 players, cameras, handheld game consoles, and other electronics were to be kept stored in student lockers. Students were discouraged from using their devices during lunch, as well as from even bringing these electronics to school, due to theft and lost valuables issues. Any students caught using personal electronic devices during school hours would have their electronics confiscated for the day. Although this rule was followed quite strictly as a school, there were some teachers that allowed students to bring personal mp3 players to listen to music while doing work as a reward for good behaviour. This policy regarding personal electronic devices was also clearly stated at the front of the student agenda.\\n  References:\\nTDSB – Code of Online Conduct\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=262&menuid=23189&pageid=20102\\nTDSB – Code of Conduct\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/ppf/uploads/files/live/98/206.pdf\\n ,\\n8,846,5,          My Fall 2012 placement was at Brookside Public School in Scarborough, Ontario. Brookside P.S. is part of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). This was my first placement with TDSB. While this placement school did not have as much technology equipment as my previous experiences, they made a conscious effort to integrate their technological resources into classrooms. This paper will discuss the use of technology within Brookside P.S. and the TDSB. The use of technology in a school-wide setting will be interpreted through Brookside’s mission statement, technological resources and classroom integration. Finally, school board policies will be dissected in order to understand technological integration on a macro scale. \\n          Brookside P.S. is unique from most other elementary schools due to its commitment to the environment and integrating technology. Brookside has been recognized and awarded for its dedication to teaching environmental responsibility. This value is engrained as deep as the schools mission statement. Technology, on the other hand, is a both a challenge and a priority to the school. Brookside P.S. has a limited amount of technological resources. In their mission statement it states that their education “is geared towards the use of technology”. This mission is met inconsistently due to its limited resources. Their classroom computers are outdated and virtually non-operational during lessons. The school also has eight Smartboards that are shared and rotated on a monthly schedule. This means teachers can only integrate the Smartboard for two months of the school year.\\n           While the resources create a challenge to consistently meet their mission towards integrating technology, the school policies, parent newsletters and encouragement of their faculty effectively incorporates some technology as an aspect of the school community. The teachers are urged to integrate technology within and beyond the four walls of the classroom. Early in the school year, teachers began contacting parents through e-mail to seek approval to use social media programs such ad Edmodo, Glogster and Blogger with their students. Communication with parents is primarily digital. Social media is encouraged with the conditions that the setting is safe and monitored by a parent, guardian or teacher. Students must also adhere to the school boards online code of conduct. Brookside is evolving its mission regarding technology to further integrate social media, yet the TDSB is late in following these expectations and standards.\\n          The TDSB explains that the use of technology must be relevant and suitable to student achievement. In their statement on their technology infrastructure, they explain that, “the appropriate use of technology in schools to enable powerful teaching practices has been increasingly recognized as a force in education to excite student learning”. This begs the question of what is considered to be appropriate uses of technology in school. The TDSB explains that they have “60,000 desktop computers, 1,200 laptop computers, 700 PDAs...” While they focus on the hardware supplied, they neglect to discuss their integration of social media. Social media is an enormous aspect of teaching with technology, and cannot be overlooked. The TDSB is specific in outlining the limitations of technology, rather than the multitude of its uses. It continues to appear as if it fears the outcomes or influences of the fully integrated classroom. By having students sign their agenda’s code of online conduct, and receive lectures from both teachers and administration about adhering to a growing list of rules and regulations on students’ technology use; the school board is in fact segregating itself from their invested technology. \\n  List of Work Cited\\nToronto District School Board, Our Technology Infrastructure, http://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=309&menuid=4374&pageid=3710\\n  Toronto District School Board, Code of On-line Conduct, http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/about_us/communications/docs/OCC.pdf\\n  Brookside Public School Agenda\\n     ,\\n8,847,5,Please find attached my visual arts lesson plan on Prehistoric Art Marking.

Compared to other schools I have been placed in, the technology at this school was abundant. They had an excellent system set up. This system revolved around the idea of “pods”. Every 4 or 5 classrooms shared a pod which was a room located in the middle of all of the other classrooms. This pod was designated for technology use. In the pods there were 2 sets of desktops, a cart of laptops, a smart board, and a technology cart (equipped with speakers, laptop, elmo, etc.). All the classrooms took full advantage of the pod and it seemed to be a wonderful space for learning.\\n  After reading through the students’ agenda, specifically the section on technology, it is obvious that the schools’ policies related to technology are there to ensure the safety of the students and support a healthy learning environment.\\n  There are two sections in the technologies policies. The first section, computer usage, speaks to the use of computers for curriculum purposes. Students are not allowed to have access to social networking sites, chat rooms, etc. Throughout the practicum I came across a couple sites that were blocked (for example Sporcle –a trivia website) which I planned to use in my lessons. Although initially they were blocked, this was not a problem. There is lots of tech at this school. Some teachers and administrative staff have the ability to unblock sites for learning purposes. Consequently, this policy did not interfere with my teaching or the student learning.\\n  The second policy looks at Internet safety. This policy stems from the concern of student safety. For example, ensuring that students do not give out personal information or pictures over the Internet. Policies such as this are integral to keeping students safe. Throughout my practicum I would give my students assignments on the computer, although I was circulating, I could not see what the students were doing on the computer all the time. Between monitoring the websites students visit and preparing them with safety rules, technology use at this school definitely supported student learning.\\n  The York Region District School Board’s technology policies are very explicit in their explanations. The school outlines most of the board policies, however, the board does go into much more detail. The one discrepancy I found was the use of social networking sites. While Fossil Hill blocks some of these sites, the board permits their use as long as it is for educational purposes. Throughout my years at OISE I have learned many practical strategies for the use of social networking sites in schools. For example, twitter, this site can be used to demonstrate learning after a presentation, share ideas with classmates, or practice writing ideas in a condensed fashion. I am glad to see that the board recognizes the importance of these websites.\\n  Overall this school impressed me with their use of technology. Their unique set-up and adherence to the board and school policies produced an effective and safe learning environment for all the students.\\n  Bibliography\\n  http://www.safekids.com/kids-rules-for-online-safety/  (Fossil Hill – Student Agenda)\\n  http://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/p&p/a/policy/194.pdf  (York Region Policies),\\n8,853,1,,\\n8,854,1,  All of my practicums to date have taken place in Toronto District School Board (TDSB) middle schools, so my experience with technology in the classroom/school has been relatively similar during all three placements.  During this past placement I was at Oakdale Park Middle School.  There are approximately 550 students that attend Oakdale between grade 6 and grade 8.  What I observed was that the classroom I was placed in was the only classroom with access to a SMARTboard.  However, all classrooms had access to one laptop and projector to be used primarily by the teacher during lessons.  In addition there was 1 set of laptops (approximately 20) that were assigned to the grade 8 classes.  The rest of the school was expected to share the computer lab (approximately 30 computers).  Each class was only scheduled one time per week in the computer lab for a one-hour class.  It is worth noting however, that in addition to a limited amount time in the lab, the lab was in very poor condition with many computers either missing a keyboard and/or mouse and in some cases computers were not working at all.\\n  Further, the demographic of the majority of the students that attend Oakdale Park are students who live in mixed housing and who do not have access to computers and other technology devices at home.  Over the course of my placement I asked students to print pieces of final work and discovered just how difficult it was for some students to gain access to a computer, let alone one with a working printer.  Further, I worked with my grade 6 social studies class to prepare PowerPoint presentations.  I was surprised at how technologically illiterate most of the students were.  \\n  The TDSB policy on technology speaks to a commitment to provide students with access to technology in the school, as there is an understanding that some students do not have access to technology at home.  TDSB aims to “give students with little or no access to technology an edge to compete with children coming from more affluent homes where technology is available.  Consequently, the board guarantees access to affordable education technology for all classrooms (Technology Infrastructure).  Additionally, the TDSB Classroom Technology Migration Initiative (CTMI) “establishes the framework for a supportable, advanced, and secured on-line learning environment.”  However, in my experience at Oakdale Park, the TDSB has not successfully reached its goals.  While each individual student has access to a login number to save work, there are not enough resources in the school for students to truly become technologically literate and gain the necessary skills “that will transform the way they learn and help prepare them for how they’ll use technology in their future careers” (Increasing Access to Technology).\\n  Lastly, the TDSB has made a commitment to deliver “nearly 18,000 laptops…to more than 360 schools across the board” for students ranging from Kindergarten to Grade 12 (Increasing Access to Technology).  While I may sound cynical, I am truly disheartened by what I have seen in regards to technology with the TDSB.  I believe it is going to take more than a commitment to access to laptops to truly make the TDSB students competitive in the digital age.  Compared to the Peel District School Board, for instance which is pushing BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) to school to promote the use of technology in students’ everyday lives, I feel the TDSB is far behind and as a result is a disservice to the students. \\n  Resources:\\n  TDSB website:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/\\n  Increasing technology in the TDSB:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/about_us/media_room/room.asp?show=allNews&view=detailed&self=34389\\n  TDSB: Our Technology Infrastructure\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=309&menuid=4374&pageid=3710\\n  Oakdale Park Middle School:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/schools/index.asp?schno=3209 \\n ,\\n8,856,5,Here is my lesson (sort of unit) for Visual Arts, titled: Portraiture: Proportions & Personality.

I have included an attachment of the power point that I created and used in the introductory part to the unit (the last slide was a black and white photograph of myself  that i used to draw the lines of facial proportions along with the students, but i deleted it to post here). As well, the photographs of student work are embedded in my lesson plan, one from each grade (since their tasks were all a bit different). I also attached a photograph of scaffolding steps that I put on chart paper and hung in the classroom as the students worked on their portraits. \\n  For the famous artists\\' works that i used and referred to in my lesson, please see the power point. ,\\n8,857,1,              For this term I was placed at Northlea Elementary and Middle School, which is part of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB).  Northlea is a K-8 school and is located at Bayview Ave. and Eglinton Ave. in quite an affluent area of Toronto.  The school is equipped with approximately 5 SMARTboards, which are shared throughout the school, a permanent SMARTboard in the Special Education Primary/Junior D.D. class, a permanent Promethean Board in the Special Education Junior/Intermediate D.D. class, netbooks, laptops, approximately 30 computers in the library, and readily available internet access.  As well, there is a language lab that houses assistive technologies for students with special needs (i.e., speech feedback, talking dictionaries, word prediction, and audio file creation).  In addition to the technologies provided at school it is clear that many of the students have technology readily available at home.\\n          While in my placement I was working in the Spec. Ed J/I D.D. class where unlike the other students in the school, these 9 students did not commute to school from the affluent neighbourhood, and not all of them had direct access to different technologies at home or personally.  However, one student had an mp3 player that was found in his desk and that he took out in class twice throughout my time there.  My AT reminded the student that during that day while at school, as well as on field trips, personal devices (cell phones, ipods, mp3 players, etc) are not to be used and are to remain in their backpacks.  This policy is clearly outlined in the front portion of the students’ agendas, under the section entitled Cell Phone and Electronic Devices, where it states that all devices should remain in the students backpacks while in school or at school related events.  I was also present for the confiscation of cell phones from certain students during the school dance that I helped to supervise.  Finally, during the first week of observation the Principal held an assembly to go over the student agenda, which included talking about the technology policies. \\n          In being able to witness each of these events it became clear that the students of the school are aware of the policies in place in regards to technology and that the school reinforces them in all situations.  Although the incidents described above may seem as though technology is a nuisance in classrooms, I believe that technology enhances student learning.  The opportunity to use the Promethean board, see students at work on the computers and use adaptive technologies, made it quite clear how relevant and helpful technology truly is, in both the special education program and throughout the rest of the school.\\n          There was no clear “advertising” throughout the school that displayed the school’s technology policies.  I was made aware of it in my AT’s school binder, which included the TDSB’s Code of Online-Conduct form.  This form discusses the appropriate use of technologies, such as websites, chatting, etc and what is appropriate and what is not appropriate for staff, students, and teachers.  During my observation week in September the form went home and was to be signed by the students and their parents.  The final tool that was used to discuss technology policies appears on the schools website under Cyberbullying Safety, which discusses signs, symptoms, how to deal with cyberbullying, as well as Tips for Parents.  As well as the section under Other Information: Electronic Devices, which discusses the appropriate use of personal student devices and the rules when in possession of such devices within the school.\\n          Although there are many issues related to technology, I still believe that technology enhances student learning.  I used the Promethean Board on a daily basis, and engaged the students and provided them with hands on opportunities to engage with the technology.  Thus furthering their understanding and allowing them to express their knowledge in alternative ways.  This was specifically helpful for those students in my class who were non-verbal.  Through all of this as well as partaking in their computer lab classes, it was clear that technology helped, my students specifically, a great deal.  In the future I plan on implementing technology where I can in my teaching, but believe it is important to review the TDSB’s as well as the school’s specific technology policies.  Northlea had very few issues with technology during my stay, therefore supporting the success of their policies. \\n    Works Cited\\n  Toronto District School Board Operational Procedure PR571, Code of Online Conduct,\\nreviewed October 2012 http://www.tdsb.on.ca/ppf/uploads/files/live/96/294.pdf\\n  Toronto District School Board Northlea Elementary and Middle School Student Agenda\\n  Toronto District School Board: Northlea Elementary and Middle School Official Website: Cyber Safety: http://www.northleaschool.ca/parent-info/cyber-safety/\\nDiscussion of Electronic Devices: http://www.northleaschool.ca/parent-info/other-info/\\n     ,\\n8,858,2,In this lesson, students found created a line design drawing of an image related to their culture. I hope you enjoy it.\\n  Shael,\\n8,859,1,     This practicum, I was placed in a grade 4 French immersion class at Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in the York Region District School Board (YRDSB).  I noticed that the majority of the teachers in the school frequently used technology.   Although one of my placements last year was also in YRDSB, there was much more technology available at this school including SMARTboards, laptops, document cameras, ipads, and computer labs, than at my previous practicum school where I used only an overhead projector.\\n          The board’s policy #194.0 called “Appropriate use of technology” outlines the terms under which technology should be used in schools.   The policy indicates that the board supports the use of technology in schools and that not only can technology support daily operating activities, but also benefit student achievement.  The guidelines found in the policy document apply to all members of the school community, including superintendents, principals, teachers, and students, who are all users of technology.  The document also clearly outlines irresponsible and unethical use of technology as well as a description of social networking sites.\\n       During practicum, I did not notice any posters or information around the school about acceptable use of technology, however, during the first week of school, a letter named “Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement” was sent home with the students.  The letter outlines the expectations for students surrounding the use of technology, including respectful, responsible use and the reporting of problems.  The letter must be signed by both the student and the parent and returned to the school.  Although there were no advertisements in the school about appropriate usage, the school has a “Security Awareness” section available on their website.  Provided on this page are multiple links to interactive games that quiz the students about topics such as meeting people online, file-sharing, spyware and others.\\n       In my classroom, I did not find that there was much discussion surrounding rules when using technology and the Internet.  During work on the computers, this did not seem to be a problem and the students worked well.   However, we encountered a small problem when my associate teacher introduced the students to the website Kidblog.  The students were required to write a personal response to a reflection question at home for homework.  No expectations were outlined with respect to appropriate use of the website.  A couple of days later, there was a supply teacher in and that evening, my associate teacher noticed that the students had been using the site to discuss how they felt about the supply teacher that day.  We then had to have a discussion with the students about using the site only for the purpose that had been outlined.  This event made it clear to me that no matter the age of your students, it is always important to explicitly identify the specific guidelines for any new technology that is being introduced to students.  This practicum opened my eyes to the various ways that technology is being used in schools, and I enjoyed having the opportunity to explore this in my teaching practices.\\n      Security Awareness.

After looking at the Appropriate Use of Technology document, I believe that YRDSB understands that technology is a growing and important part of today\\'s society and schools. However, the document itself (and the Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement) are more concerned with the rules and regulations of what is and is not allowed in the classroom when using technology (i.e. using computers in a proper manner, no sharing private information). To ensure appropriateness, these documents outline the responsibilities for all members of the school community when using technology in the classroom. Of significant note, the Appropriate Use of Technology document states that it is the accountability of the faculty (teachers, principals) to ensure that students are using technology properly. This allows teachers the freedom to promote technology in the classroom. Therefore, if students had a teacher that was more tech savvy, then (in theory) the technological possibilities for student learning are enhanced. Unless the teacher is doing something with technology that is unethical, teachers have the ability to use technology in many ways to assist the learning needs of students. Fossil Hill itself is very proactive in using technology to enhance student learning and the school encourages students to experiment with technology provided that they treat all technological devices with respect. Fossil Hill has a wide array of technological devices, such as laptops, Smartboards, iPads, and document cameras, that are used by teachers and students constantly in their classrooms. This would not be possible if YRDSB did not promote the use of technology.\\n  Similarly, the school agenda provides various rules and regulations for students to follow when using technology. Although, the school agenda mirrors the Appropriate Use of Technology document closely, there are two exceptions. Although the Appropriate Use of Technology document does not limit the use of social networking sites (as long as they are supervised by a teacher), the agenda clearly states that no social networking sites be used in school. Furthermore, Fossil Hill strongly discourages students from bringing their personal music players, cell phones or other technological equipment. These rules are implemented by Fossil Hill due to the safety concerns of the students; it does limit student learning as social network sites could have beneficial uses.\\n  In future, I would strongly recommend that both the Appropriate Use of Technology document and the school agenda provide a section that discusses what students are allowed to do when using technology. My associate teacher happened to be the technology lead of the school and his students were strongly encouraged to use technology. If however a school did not have these technological devices nor faculty promoting technology, then student learning would be limited. The Appropriate Use of Technology document should better outline what they consider to be appropriate (and should state that they are not limited to these rules) so students have a stronger idea of how to use technology taking some of the onus away from the teacher. These documents should focus more on the \"do\\'s\" and to a lesser extent the \"do not\\'s\".\\n  References:\\n  Appropriate Use of Technology:          \\nwww.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/p&p/a/policy/194.pdf\\n  Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement:\\nwww.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/a/depts/.../AppropriateUseJunior.pdf\\n  School Agenda\\nhttp://www.fossilhill.ps.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/STU.htm\\n   ,\\n8,865,1,Stylized Portfolio Coverpage\\n   ,\\n8,866,10,    Observation week set the ground rules and policies regarding technology use in the York Catholic District School Board. On the first day of school, the school community gathered in the gymnasium to welcome students to the start of a new school year and of course, review some of the school’s policies with respect to technology and personal electronic devices. Interestingly, the school principal posed a challenge in which each student created a visual poster that informs students that PEDs are to be “off and invisible”. This slogan resonated through the school hallways and in conversation with my Associate Teacher; I learned that this slogan was established over two years ago to remind students of the strict policy regarding PEDs. Students anxiously created their visual posters to enter into the school competition. The top posters were selected from each classroom and the administrative team selected the winner. While observing my students create their posters, it struck me how one student wrote as their slogan: “Cell phones OFF keeps learning ON”. It troubles me to think that learning and technology are viewed in isolation from one another. \\n      The York Catholic District School Board’s policy regarding Personal Electronic Devices states that all PEDs must be out-of-site during the school day unless the school principal grants special permission. During my observation week, parents/guardians were asked to sign a consent form to acknowledge that students are not permitted PEDs during the school day. Also, parents/guardians were asked to review safe and proper use of technology with their children (i.e. the internet, social media) at the start of the school year. These guidelines are listed in the Parent Handbook that is sent home with students during the first week of school. \\n      At my placement school, each classroom teacher had access to a Promethean Board. Some teachers frequently utilized the tool while others never received training on how to effectively use it in their instructional practice. The first time my students were exposed to the interactive whiteboard was through my own teaching. Through some of my lessons, students had the opportunity to create concept maps and access YouTube videos to facilitate their understanding of concepts. In addition, the school has access to one computer lab of approximately twenty-five computers. Teachers have one 45-minute period a week to bring their students to the lab. A rotation schedule was established during the first week of school.\\n     “The YCDSB is committed to providing all students access to the curriculum through the use of assistive technology” (YCDSB website). It is evident that the board is committed to offering assistive technologies for a wide range of learners. Several students in my Grade 4 class were offered frequent one-on-one support through programs like Kurzweil 3000, Inspiration, and Dragon Naturally Speaking Professional. In conclusion, my placement school is committed to student learning through the use of assistive technologies however; the school board strongly regulates the use of PEDs to prevent their negative impacts on the school environment. \\n  LINKS\\n  York Catholic District School Board\\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca \\n  Divine Mercy Catholic Elementary School \\nhttp://dmy.ycdsb.ca\\n  Parent Handbook\\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca/parents_students/documents/YCDSB_Parent_Handbook_2011.pdf\\n  Code of Conduct\\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca/trustees/documents/policies/Code_Conduct.pdf\\n  Personal Electronic Devices - Student Use \\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca/trustees/documents/policies/PEDs_StudentUse.pdf\\n  Employee Acceptable Use of Information Technology \\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca/trustees/documents/policies/IT_Acceptable_EmployeeUse.pdf\\n  Student Services / Special Education \\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca/departments/instructionalservices/studentservices/assistive_technology.htm\\n         ,\\n8,867,2,During my practicum at St. Francis of Assisi Elementary School, I was pleased to see that the TCDSB recognizes the changing nature and increasing use of technology by students and teachers.        Technology was widely used at the school – each class had a SMART board, intermediate classes shared 30 netbooks, there was school-wide wifi, in my LD class there were computers with adaptive technology, and students could play educational games online. All teachers used technology to differentiate their instruction.\\n            Students and parents were required to sign the TCDSB Acceptable Use Policy for Technology, Student Internet Agreement form (see attached), which relates to the Acceptable Use Policy (A.29) (AUP).  The AUP governs the use of social media, website publishing and personal electronic devices (PEDs), outlines restrictions like cyber-bullying and states that students’ use of technology at school is a privilege, not a right.\\n            In September 2012, the TCDSB enacted the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy which states that PEDs, including cell phones and laptops, are not mandatory in school, but may be used if there is a clear educational purpose. The BYOD allows administrators and teachers to decide the terms of appropriate use. My Associate Teacher’s rule is that PEDs can’t be used during class unless permission is granted, and if a student is caught, their PED will be taken away until the end of the day. As ringing cell phones were an issue and distraction in my classroom, I felt that taking a phone away was a suitable solution.\\n            Overall, I strongly support the TCDSB’s policies and I believe that they serve the best interest of students, support their learning, and help students become responsible technology users. Both the policies and technology in general aid student learning because they leveled the playing field for many of my students and allowed me to teach more effectively with all abilities and multiple intelligences in mind.  For example, in one math class I was able to use adaptive technology, the SMART Board, online math games and calculators on PEDs to make sure that all students in my class understood the lesson and could appropriately and independently practice using the skills we learned.  \\n            I believe that all students still have a right to access technology that belongs to the school. I fear that if school boards begin to think that students are capable of providing their own learning resources/technology, they will fund school technology less, which will impede the learning of many students, particularly students of low socio-economic status and students with special needs.\\n            I also believe that the policies could in fact be implemented in inequitable ways if teachers and schools are not careful. In my practicum, while one student benefitted from using organizational apps on his iPod, I saw another student become extremely frustrated because he didn’t have anything additional to use when the computers in the class were broken or being used by another student. Also, there were times when other classes needed the netbooks, or when it took weeks for a technician to fix technology, so not all of my students had the adaptive tools they needed.  In these instances, I found that the policies were inequitable in my class of special needs students, and I believe that these issues should be addressed going forward in a timely manner so that all students benefit from technology use in schools.\\nReferences\\nAUP (A.29) - http://www.tcdsb.org/board/policies/aup/Pages/default.aspx\\nBYOD - http://www.tcdsb.org/Board/Policies/AUP/Documents/AUP%20Agenda%20Insert%20for%20Elementary%20Schools.pdf\\nAUP Agenda Insert (attached)\\nAUP Gr.4-8 Contract (attached)\\nPersonal Communication via Email from Irene Nina, Educator, St. Francis of Assisi (attached),\\n8,868,1,Creating an African Tribal Mask by the use of symmetry, contrast and patterning. ,\\n8,869,1,,\\n8,870,1,,\\n8,871,1,Thanks.\\n  Jean,\\n8,872,1,  YRDSB Policy #194, “Appropriate Use of Technology”, recognizes that technology can benefit student learning and outline the conditions for appropriate use of technology, as well as the responsibilities of teachers, principles, superintendents, and students. The definition of appropriate use is common-sense and fairly broad. It includes using technology in a “responsible and ethical manner consistent with the educational, informational and recreational purposes for which they are provided”. Teachers are expected to instruct model appropriate use to students. Teachers are specifically cautioned that if they use social networking technologies they should ensure they have appropriate understanding of effective educational use of such technologies, and avoid personal uses of such technologies when communicating with students or parents.\\n  In addition, all students and parents at Bond Lake Public School are expected to sign the Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement. This agreement states that student are accountable for respecting others\\' personal information and privacy, abiding by school code of conduct and safe school policy, protecting their personal information, using school technology responsibly for educational purposes as determined by a teacher, and respecting school technology. Parents are advised to learn more about safe schools policy and internet safety on the board\\'s website.\\n  The board\\'s website contains guide for parents and guardians on cyber-bullying, including its definition, statistics, legal implications, and advice on what parents/guardians can do if their children are being cyber-bullied or are cyber-bullying someone.\\n  On the positive side, the school policies are fairly broad and provide teachers with a lot of room for professional judgement. This support teachers who are interested to integrate technology to their teaching and are confident in their proficiency to do so. However, other than a generic statement that technology can support student learning, the policy does not require teachers to integrate technology in any way, nor does it require teachers to become trained to do so. This means that students\\' exposure to various technologies as part of their schooling is highly dependent on the specific teachers they have. While I believe that providing teacher\\'s with autonomy is beneficial for teaching, I would like to see some board level or provincial guidelines regarding technological proficiency benchmarks that students should acquire during their schooling.\\n  Regarding the safe school policies and the student agreement, I feel that current policies are not effective in educating students about cyber-bullying. The students are expected to sign an agreement that is rather vague and is not written in a student friendly-language. In addition, some of the parents who are not fluent in English may not be able to fully understand the implications of cyber-bullying and may not be able to take the preventative measures offered by the board. I fear that without further action, these policies may become mere lip-service to the issue. I would recommend to revise the policy so that each student would be required to complete an age-appropriate online module on cyber-bullying and appropriate use of technology as a condition to be granted access to board\\'s technology.\\n  Source:\\n  Board Policy #194.0 - Appropriate Use of Technology \\nhttp://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/p&p/a/policy/194.pdf\\n    Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement - Junior Students \\nhttp://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/a/depts/curriculum/AppropriateUseJunior.pdf\\n  Cyberbullying- A Guide for Parents and Guardians\\nhttp://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/w/innovation/safeschools/CyberbullingCard.pdf\\n ,\\n8,873,2,        Last week I finished my fall practicum at Wedgwood Junior School (TDSB) teaching Kindergarten to Grade 5 Physical Education and Health. Upon my initial observation I noticed a computer lab located in the school library and a Smart-board in each of the grade 4 and 5 classrooms as well as the Homeschool Program (HSP) classroom. Throughout my time at Wedgewood I also learned of something called the Lego League. The Lego League took place at lunch with the goal of the program being to empower students through science and technology.\\n   “The program is to provide an inspirational learning experience for children by celebrating science and technology, and combining educational context with hands-on challenges that empower children to create their own theories and solutions.”(Wedgewood Home Website)    \\n  The overall reaction from the students was outstanding, they were able to manipulate the Lego (something that they were familiar with) with the use of technology. They used trial an error strategies to create and recreate a variety of moving structures and mini-robots. \\n              In teaching in the 21st century it is apparent that technology does indeed have the power to enhance learning. However, diverse classrooms within the TDSB present families that range in socio-economic status. Technology isn’t always available at home and it can vary (example: from no technology, to a Windows 95 computer, to a brand new I-pad). How can educators bridge the gap between students who have access to technology at home, compared to students who do not? The Toronto District School Board states:\\n  “Access to current education technology at school can give students with little or no access to technology an edge to compete with children coming from more affluent homes where technology is available. Guaranteeing access for all classrooms to affordable education technology in order to achieve curricular goals helps to address the inequities that exist among schools and districts in the availability of instructional resources.”(TDSB Website)  \\n             It is our Job as educators to create a positive and inclusive learning environment for all of students, as in all subjects we must be aware of our students needs and individual abilities. From my personal experience as a teacher, technology has helped engage my students, and it has allowed them to explore concepts in different ways. One of the greatest complements I received when leaving Wedgewood was from a grade 5 student. He said, “Mr. Lekas before you taught science we used to hate it, but you made it fun.” I taught the entire science unit on the Human Organ System using the smart-board, making the unit as interactive as possible. Without this form of technology I don’t think the unit would be as ‘fun’ as it turned out to be. Technology doesn’t only engage students but it can also enrich learning. Technologies such as the smart-board and programs such as the Lego League assist teachers with differentiated instruction allowing students to learn in a number of ways, which in turn promotes students to be curious, ask questions, and make sense of the world.    \\n    http://www.tdsb.on.ca/Schools/index.asp?schno=2025\\n  http://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=309&menuid=4374&pageid=3710#CTMI,\\n8,874,1,,\\n8,875,1,,\\n8,876,1,,\\n8,877,1,Hi Limin,\\n  Thank you!

Can something be done to accommodate both situations? \\n  Thanks,\\n  Jean (Yr 2 J/I),\\n8,880,2,I became aware of the extensive technology-related policies and procedures that exist within the York Catholic District School Board (YCDSB) during my placement at a small school with a tightly-knit community, St. Joseph the Worker Catholic School. Students attending this school ranged from JK-Grade 8 and my placement was in a Grade 8 classroom.\\n  During observation week, I became familiar with the technology utilized at the school, the technological resources available for use by teachers and students, and the technology-related policies and procedures that were in place. I quickly became aware of the lack of technological resources at the school. In my classroom, there were three large and dated desktop computers and one bulky overhead projector. Only one cart was available for rent from the library and this cart held a large and dated laptop and a projector. I did not notice any SMARTboards in the entire school and most classrooms had blackboards rather than whiteboards. My classroom was one of the few classrooms that had computers and often times, students from different grades came into the classroom to work on the computers. The library was equipped with 30 bulky and dated desktop computers that operated slowly. Bringing my students into the library for a research session was unproductive due to the poor Internet connection and the dated software on the computers. It was from my initial tour of the library during observation week that I had a gut feeling that the computers were in poor working condition and would not have the up-to-date software that I was used to using at school and at home.\\n  Prior to this placement, I had just begun feeling comfortable and confident enough in utilizing the SMARTboard and its many features to conduct my own lessons. Once at St. Joe’s, I was disappointed that I would not be able to practice my recently acquired technology skills nor would I be able to work on and practice using current technological resources, essentially I felt that my teaching would be lagging behind in the technology trend.\\n  YCDSB’s technology-related policies and procedures became apparent to me when technology-related agreement forms were sent home in September. All students receiving education in the YCDSB and their parents/guardians, “...will sign annually the grade appropriate Student Acceptable Use of Information Technology Agreement prior to accessing Board information technology, either at school or remotely” (Policy #311). At St. Joe’s, I saw two such forms, one for students in JK-Grade 3 and another form for students in Grades 4-8, whereby the number of agreements are greater for those students in the Junior and Intermediate divisions. A related policy #408 is aimed at teachers and their use of information technology.\\n  My associate teacher implemented his own rules related to cell phone use. Upon entering of his classroom, all cell phones were to be either put on silence or turned off, and at the start of each school day, cell phones needed to be placed in a basket that was stored in the classroom closet until the end of the day. YCDSB’s policy #222 speaks to this, stating that for students in elementary grades, “all personal electronic devices (PEDs) carried by students shall be kept out-of-sight, turned off and not used during the day” unless authorized by the principal.\\n    References:\\nYork Catholic District School Board: http://www.ycdsb.ca\\n  St. Joseph the Worker Catholic School: http://sjw.ycdsb.ca/\\n  Student Acceptable Use of Information Technology\\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca/trustees/documents/policies/IT_Acceptable_StudentUse.pdf\\n  Employee Acceptable Use of Information Technology\\nhttp://www.ycdsb.ca/trustees/documents/policies/IT_Acceptable_EmployeeUse.pdf\\n  Personal Electronic Devices (PEDS) – Student Use: http://www.ycdsb.ca/trustees/documents/policies/PEDs_StudentUse.pdf\\n  Student Acceptable Use of Information Technology for:\\nJunior Kindergarten – Grade 3 (see attachment)\\nJunior & Intermediate Students – Grades 4 – 8 (see attachment),\\n8,881,1,,\\n8,882,1,I wish I saw this!

For example, many of the games for grade 4 would be highly relevant to grade 5 and 6 curriculum expectations as well.\\n  The lesson plans often refer to the appendices, and it would be useful to read them in advance. The appendices contain useful tools including warm-up activities, stretches, fitness, strength, and endurance activities, ideas for DPA, program planning tools, and teaching and assessment strategies and tools.\\n  Each lesson plan lists curriculum expectations being addressed, both strand specific expectations(active living, movement competence, and healthy living)and living skills expectations. There is a huge variety of lesson addressing expectations from all strands.\\n  Regarding social justice, the lesson plans do not contain specific suggestions for accommodation or differentiation. The website has an “inclusion” section, which includes adapted lesson plans, but this section contains only print resources (that members can order for free). It would have been nice to have the material in this section available electronically as well.\\n  As someone without any prior experience in teaching physical education, I found this website invaluable during my last practicum when I had to teach several physical education classes. I would use it consistently as my main tool for planning a physical education program.,\\n8,891,1,www.playsport.net,\\n8,892,1,Don\\'t forget...smoking kills! ,\\n8,893,1,,\\n8,894,2,,\\n8,895,2,www.vihart.com\\n  As far as I can tell so far, a random person who\\'s interested in math.,\\n8,896,1,,\\n8,897,2,CSC is a huge resource for a variety of subjects.

Roddick and Julie Sliva,\\n8,920,7,     During my practicum at Upper Canada College, I had the great opportunity to take on the role of assisting the head ICT integrator in various projects, from leading his pilot study on digital student response systems in my own science classes to co-facilitating a Latin teacher’s adoption of iPad-mirroring to replace the SMART Board. While such initiatives may arise in isolation within academic departments, teachers keep in mind that their implementation is made possible by virtue of UCC’s dedicated network, and more recently, a mandatory 1:1 laptop program. As a corollary, UCC’s entire technological infrastructure—including policies and practices—is maintained solely by its own IT and ICT integration departments.\\n      The immediate advantage of this autonomy is that the policies are developed with the school’s idiosyncrasies in mind, including UCC’s recent registration with a Google domain (highlighting a school-wide shift towards cloud computing), the boarding community, a highly layered organizational structure within the faculty, and other factors. For example, the 1:1 program necessitates a protocol for retrieving lost laptops that seamlessly integrate with the school’s own communication infrastructure:\\n    This is contrasted with board-wide policies such as the TDSB’s Code of On-Line Conduct and PDSB’s Use of Technology Code that can only practically focus on universal human elements of ethical use, personal safety, and access to inappropriate material. With a specificity that is relevant to the school in its wholeness, UCC’s policy also implies a student-cultural influence towards technology’s true integration into school life, rather than being just a tool that needs to be booked in advance and monitored during work periods in the library.\\n      For example, the Student Laptop and Network Agreement provides guidelines on battery maintenance, serving a dual purpose of teaching good practice in computer care and minimizing disruptions to learning.\\n    Disruptions to learning due to technology are less considered a matter of classroom management, as students are generally allowed to turn on their laptops during a lecture with the trust that they do not violate school code (as well as the canonical expectations upheld throughout board policies). This trust is acknowledged by signing UCC’s Acceptable Use of Technology Student Agreement form.\\n      Arguably the best known role of UCC’s IT Department among students is as a passive enforcer through web surveillance and defense. The network is configured to send files of unknown formats through an automated scanning-and-approval procedure. As well, websites considered to host inappropriate material (games, pornography, gambling, etc.) as well as Facebook are blocked. However, observations of students occasionally accessing gaming sites show that these measures can be imprecise, though it is uncertain whether a more robust measure is possible. Furthermore, such measures could potentially have the opposite effect; students in a computer programming class have been hindered in a unit on game development, and an innovative teacher once experienced difficulty retrieving a file to supplement his otherwise technologically-enhanced lesson.\\n      All in all, implementing a 1:1 laptop program profoundly enhanced the learning experience for students in all aspects of academic and educational life. It may be obvious that the merits of technological integration are greater than the sum of their parts; these merits are not strictly additive, for as with just about any new system, technology needs to be in the right setting to be valuable and viable. UCC’s thoughtfully-planned policy on technological use is but one indicator of that. â– \\n  Sources & Links\\n  Note: Unfortunately, the IT/ICT Integration Departments asked me, for reasons of school document creatorship and ownership within independent schools, not to share the school’s policy documents in their entirety.

What I find special about dance is that each style has its own roots and origins that can be traced back to different cultures. Dance is interconnected, intertwined, and can cross different cultures and backgrounds. Salsa, for example, is a dance whose origin comes from the dance styles of African Rumbas. It is hugely popular in South America, but is also can be seen in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. When I was first introduced to Salsa, my instructor was of Irananian descent. Through Salsa we became friiends and are still friends to this day. Furthermore, going to salsa clubs introduced me to people of different races and nationalities; all with a love of salsa. I strongly  believe that dance has the power to bring people together from all walks of life. I use salsa as an example because of my own experiences, but I strongly feel that all forms of dance has this same power.\\n  Secondly, there are many reasons why people dance, all of which are valid and imporant. Some people dance because it is fun to do. Others may dance as a way to exercise and become physically fit. And then there are those people that dance because \"they need to dance\". You may have heard stories from people who say that \"dance saved my life\". This is so true. I was watching the TV show \"So You Think You Can Dance\" over the summer and I watched an overweight man audition for the show. He explained to the judges that he is the only male member of his family not either in jail or doing drugs. He believed that it was through dance that allowed him to escape this possible life. This is just one of the many stories that I have heard about how dance has become peoples escape.\\n  Another story that affected me was a man who wanted to dance as his career, but whose father did not support this (and his) \"lifestyle\". To rob people of the ability to dance is (to me) a crime. Dance is an extension of body and mind, and each dance movement can emit emotion and expression. To take away the power of expression, freedom, and release would be wrong.\\n  Although I could talk much longer about dance, I want to wrap up this comment by two quotes:\\n  “Let us read, and let us dance; these two amusements will never do any harm to the world.” - Voltaire\\n  “Dance, when you\\'re broken open. Dance, if you\\'ve torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you\\'re perfectly free.” - Rumi\\n  And that is why I feel dance is an important part of life.,\\n8,926,1,Here is my handout for a great website with DPA activities and accompanying videos organized by division and where you are teaching DPA.\\n\\nEnjoy!,\\n8,927,1,For the mobile composer, entirely web-based\\n  http://www.noteflight.com/\\n    -Cak,\\n8,928,1,For those of you interested in bringing Apps into your class, this catalogue of apps conveniently categorized according to grade level, subject, spec-ed, the ISTE NETS, teacher resources, classroom management, and even Bloom\\'s Taxonomy may find this a convenient starting point.\\n  Appitic.com\\n  -Cak,\\n8,929,1,Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU\\n    Article: http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/did-addiction-politics-leave-us-stranded-on-a-slippery-slope/#6LD7otsYMPR8Mpzz.99\\n  Some interesting excepts:\\n  \"… In The Brain That Changes Itself, psychiatrist Norman Doidge explained the brain plasticity principles behind the decreased sexual responsiveness in his heavy porn-using patients (and its reversibility). Yet most doctors who are not neuroscience specialists still hark back to their days of Penthouse use and continue to view Internet porn use as a harmless extension. They seem unaware that today’s porn delivers far more addiction-producing neurochemical stimulation to the brain than static porn of the past, that brain scans of Internet addicts are already revealing standard addiction-related brain changes, or that today’s kids are using Internet porn extensively while their brains are uniquely plastic.\\n  ….\\nThe assumption that sexual-behavior addiction is strictly a symptom of some other primary illness produces misleading diagnoses for those wrestling with addiction-related brain changes. These include performance anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression, severe social anxiety, erectile dysfunction, performance anxiety (with one’s hand?), and so forth. Worse yet, the addicted patient is not informed that he may be able to reverse his symptoms by enduring withdrawal and changing behavior. Brain plasticity works both ways.\\n  Researchers know from other behavioral addictions that the symptoms on which such other diagnoses rest can often be a function of addiction itself (anhedonia, concentration problems, severe anxiety, etc.).\",\\n8,930,1,  Beverley Public School\\'s technology policies were not explicit within the school because of the degree of supervision while students used technology, given the special education context. The class sizes of Beverley were small (max of 8 students) and Promethean Boards were used within most classrooms under direct guidance of the teachers or EA\\'s. Students were encouraged to use technology often, and were taught to swipe or tap the Promethean or click on the ipad/itouch icons as gross and fine motor skills assessments. Students received assistance with these functions depending on need, and according to their IEP. \\n  In the TDSB Code for Online Conduct policy, 4.2.1 states that “On a global network such as the Internet it is impossible to effectively control the content of the information. On occasion, users of on-line systems may encounter material that is controversial and which other users, parents or staff might consider inappropriate or offensive. It is the responsibility of the individual user not to intentionally access such material. If such material is accessed by accident, the incident must be reported immediately to a teacher or appropriate authority.” I believe that Beverley was able to uphold this regulation because only the teachers could supervise students when they went onto the internet. Alternately, Wi-fi access was unavailable for students. \\n  Ipad and itouch technologies are currently being researched heavily at Beverley. They used technology for a variety of activities including receptive language programs, visual schedules, expressive communication, circle time, individual educational goals, play or rewards, as well as, transitions. Often students in my class watched music videos on youtube as a way of engaging in free time; indeed, part of their assessment was making choices and taking turns in activities. Technology - specifically work with the ipads or itouch - allowed students to have increased quality of life (they are able to build confidence and reduce anxiety which decreases self harm) and also increase students\\' ability to communicate their desires. \\n  During my placement, a series on Autism was featured in the Toronto Star. One of the students in the feature, Jasper, was a student who I saw every day toting his ipad around the school. He literally carried it everywhere he went. I never saw him on the internet, but he would play music (including the Black Keys!) and use the App’s downloaded onto his ipad. Many of the App’s on his ipad were featured on the Beverley website as recommended App’s for students at the school with autism. \\n    References:\\n  TDSB Code of Online Conduct:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteide=262&menuid=23189&pageid=20102\\n  Beverley\\'s Ipad and App Initiative:\\nhttp://schools.tdsb.on.ca/beverley/documents/BeverleyApps.pdf\\n  Feature on Beverley\\'s Program in Toronto Star\\'s Autism Project:\\nhttp://www.thestar.com/news/world/autismproject/article/1286058--ipads-speak-for-non-verbal-autistic-kids,\\n8,931,2,Dear Hillary, I understand this lesson is late and I apologize.

Some are technology-specific, while others are technology encompassing.  Three in particular, however, warrant highlighting:\\nBoard Policy #194.0: Appropriate Use of Technology  (specific)\\nBoard Policy #160.0: Records & Information Management, (encompasses) and\\nBoard Policy #545.0: Intellectual Property, Copyright and Professional Services (encompasses).\\nAdditionally, the government of Ontario has regulations with technology implications, particularly\\n“Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act - R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER M.56” (http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90m56_e.htm) (encompasses) (basically, the public has the right of access of information to anything done on with government funds)\\n  Technology policies are so vast that one assignment couldn’t possibly cover all of the ramifications.  For that reason, I have focused on some issues from the above policies and regulations which impact how the classroom teacher uses technology. In short, from that lens, these policies boil down to five main issues which highlight how YRDSB policies are consistent with others across disciplines and across places of employment, and a sixth which is particular to government or para-government organizations (excerpts from the policies supporting the above points are included below)\\nNothing you do while on an employers paid time belongs to you, even if it is original work;\\nAnything done on an employer’s equipment, whether technically during work time or not, falls under their policies;\\nEmployers won’t protect you if you break the law, even if you believe you were simply engaged in activities supporting your job responsibilities;\\nEmployers have the right to see any communications done while under their time, including  but not limited to your board email;\\nAnything produced/stored/transmitted on board equipment has statutory records management policies surrounding their destruction, the contravention of which can place you in a legally compromising position;\\nAdditionally, as is common with government or para-government organizations:\\nAnything you create can legally be accessed by a member of the public at any time.\\n  While many would call these common sense, or at least common to most places of employment, I suspect that many teachers would be shocked at the implications of the above statements.  The growth of such organizations as “teachers pay teachers” where there you can sell your lesson plans would technically be prohibited by these YRDSB policies.  The accidental contravention of copyright law can leave you exposed to legal ramifications without protection.  Additionally, any activity on a board laptop, even if done at home, falls under their usage policies, as does any activity on your personal device even if done through your personal 3G account if done during work hours while on board property.  An email containing disparaging comments about a parent may be accessed not only by your administrator, but also by that parent, if the parent is familiar with the method to request access to information under the “Municipal Freedom of Information” act.\\n  In general, what a review of these policies led me to was a reminder that any technology use while in a school, whether personal or board-specific, brings with it a host of legal ramifications which most classroom teachers have absolutely no understanding of.  Additionally, given increasing pressure from commercial enterprises to penalize even trivial copyright contravention, the above issues are extremely pertinent.  It is difficult to convince teachers to increase their use of technology when it causes them to be exposed to a plethora of new liabilities which are current insufficiently explored.  As such, if these policies are not accompanied by professional development, they have the potential to hinder technology uptake by teachers.\\n        Relevant Policy Excerpts:\\n  Excerpts -  Board Policy #545.0: Intellectual Property, Copyright and Professional Services (encompasses).\\nThe Board retains ownership of the intellectual property, where the Board’s resources or expertise are used to create a product or practice that may have commercial significance and when the product developed is the outcome of an assigned task or job responsibility.”\\nunderstand that the Board will not support legal fees or damage awards incurred by staff who violate the Copyright Act;\\nsecure written permission before reproducing for distribution singularly or in volume, in part or as a whole, Board documents for use outside the Board;\\nunderstand that some specific news, news commentary, television or radio programs can be taped and shown for a period of up to one year for classroom purposes without special copyright permission and without paying royalties;\\n  Excerpts - Board Policy #160.0: Records & Information Management, (encompasses)\\nAll York Region District School Board staff are responsible for: the information and records they create and maintain; and complying with this policy and procedure.\\nInformation produced for any purpose of the Board is a Board-asset.\\nRecords are information preserved in a format such as documents, e-mail messages, paper, electronic and other media and audio visual materials and are important for their content and are evidence of plans, decisions, actions and history. ….

Edwards\\n  Summary Points\\n·      This article addresses the reality of today’s schools such that educators are dealing with a hidden minority of gay and lesbian students, as well as gay and lesbian parents\\n·      Educators must work to break the silence and provide a safe and supportive network for all students\\n·      Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) offers a support system for parents seeking understanding\\n·      Both parents and students benefited from an open acceptance of diverse sexual orientations\\n·      Creating equitable and safe schools in which students may comfortably discuss their own life story is our goal as educators.\\n·      The article lists several simple guidelines to provide equity to the gay and lesbian students in our schools and homes. \\n    Questions:\\n  1.     How can we as educators create safe and equitable schools in which all students including minority groups feel accepted?\\n2.     Issues of violence, bullying and teasing arise from students who are gay or lesbian. As teachers, how would you address these situations in your school?\\n3.     Edwards\\' article offers useful and practical tips on how to make your classroom a healthy and safe space for all students. What other inclusive tools can we adopt in our teaching to ensure that all students are safe?\\n4.     Gender roles in society further marginalize and discriminate against one’s sexual orientation. As educators and role models for our students, how can we challenge gender roles in our classroom?\\n5.     How might teaching/ educating students about sexuality and oppression, differ based on the dynamics of your classroom?\\n6.    As a teacher how would you bring issues of homosexuality into your classroom?\\n·      At what age is it appropriate to discuss sexuality with your students?\\n·      What challenges might you face?\\n ,\\n8,953,1,  Policies and Programming for Safer Schools: Are “Anti-bullying” Approaches Impeding Education for Peacebuilding?\\n-          Violence hasn’t increased in schools, but there’s more of a perception of increased violence in schools.\\n-          Anti-bullying initiatives need to build conflict resolution skills (for students, teachers and administrators), mutual respect and social competence (proactive measures); unfortunately, more resources are put towards surveillance and control (reactive measures).\\n-          Anti-bullying and anti-violence initiatives are not implemented well at all.\\n-          Many kinds of student leadership initiatives: all have pros and cons, but generally show positive results.\\n  Student Leadership Opportunities for Making ‘Peace’ in Canada’s Urban Schools: Contradictions in Practice\\n-          Anti-violence efforts can be placed on a continuum:\\no   Peacekeeping   ->            peacemaking     ->           peacebuilding\\n-          Peacekeeping: control and maintain the status quo. Goal – ‘negative’ peace (safe environment).\\n-          Peacemaking: talk things out, encourage open discussion during rising conflicts. Most common form practiced in schools = peer mediation.\\n-          Peacebuilding: develop and restore healthy relationships. Repair the inequities and harms people cause on another. Facilitation of inclusive discussion is encouraged.\\n-          There are many strategies, activities, and initiatives that can be conducted in an effort to promote peace and citizenship. They vary widely though, both in character (how controlling should peace-promoting agents be?) and inclusivity (what kinds of people/characters should be selected for these peace-promoting agents?)\\n-          Overall, faculty and administration rarely provides on-going opportunities for students to participate actively in governance and leadership. \\n    Questions\\n-          Bickmore claims that “bullying” is overused and she criticizes that some schools encourage students to report any instance of “bullying.” What would your approach to a rule like this be?\\n-          So many issues have caused an inappropriate handling of bullying today. What can you, as a 1st or 2nd year teacher, do to better the situation?  \\n-          Describe an experience you had with student bullying in your practicum schools. (What happened? How was it handled? Generally, did the school engage in reactive or proactive measures?)\\n-          Think back to Lawrence Kholberg’s stages of moral development. Do you think students need to be at a certain level for these strategies (in the Bickmore & MacDonald article) to work or would these strategies work at any level? Describe some of the strategies that you think would or would not work.\\n-          How controlling should cadre members be?\\n-          Should a cadre involve a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture of students? ,\\n8,955,2,  Student Leadership Opportunities for Making \\'Peace\\' in Canada\\'s Urban Schools: Contradictions in Practice. Interamerican Journal of Education for Democracy, 3(2), pp. 126-152, 2010.\\n  Bickmore\\'s (2010) study illustrates different methodologies aimed at reducing violence and promoting inclusion within schools. She highlights three varieties of anti-violence work: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding. The first two are seen as means toward \"negative peace\", a necessary but insufficient condition of democracy, whereas effective peacebuilding measures can intervene in institutional structures to provide a truly equitable space.\\n  Peacekeeping strategies generally consist of safety and security measures, exemplified here by peer monitor programs. One major obstacle to equity is that the \"peers\" may be selected by teachers or administration based on pre-ordained attributes, and their responsibilities might reinforce pre-existing disparities in power and/or status.\\n  Peacemaking through explicit conflict resolution education may entail any number of strategies but the most well-researched method is peer mediation, which fosters academic achievement in addition to its goal of nonviolence. In some cases, mediators are small \"cadres\" of leaders, and sometimes it is a whole-class or -school endeavour, built into the curriculum.\\n  Peacebuilding refers to a process of developing and restoring equitable, healthy relationships, which can be achieved through \"well-facilitated, open and inclusive discussion of meaningful issues\" (Bickmore, 2010). For such action to be effective, a diverse group of students must be able to \"exercise democratic agency\" (Bickmore 2010).\\n  The study clarifies the imperative of student self-governance and emancipation, and the curricular incorporation of non-violent education. It cannot be simply a module; the more it is integrated with the school\\'s policies, the more resources (material and human) can be dedicated to the cause.\\n  Discussion Questions:\\n  1. What were your experiences with nonviolent education:\\na) in your own schooling history\\nb) in extra-curricular contexts\\nc) in your practicum placements\\nand how will they inform your future practice?\\n  2. What factors or processes are relevant to the selection of peer mediators or student leaders? How can you foster inclusion from a position of power? What is the balance between student self-governance and administrative authority/direction?\\n  3. How active a role are you prepared to take on as a non-violent educator? What responsibilities are you comfortable fulfilling? What do the three modes of nonviolent education mean to you, and how do you prioritize them? What do you predict to be the most likely challenges?  \\n ,\\n8,957,1,Main Ideas:\\nBullying can only occur within a power-relaitonship, and goes beyond physical and verbal intimidating but can also be non-verbal social.\\nThere needs to be modelling of teachers of proper social behaviour, but where does that leave preexisitng bias and lack of training?\\nMany different programs that have been adapated.\\n  Questions:\\nIf bullying is strictly defined as being within a power based relationship, How can you talk about the existence of that pwoer in your classrom effectively?  Does this conversation occur/have you seen it?\\nProbing: Does any culture trump \\'another\\' culture? ie: Freedom of religion, Freedom of speech, in opposing thought to sexual orientation\\n  Training needs to occur for teachers, in order to better teach students about the subtle relaitonal ques, that may cause discomfort/bullying to other studets.  How comfortable do we feel with doing this? And how do we see past our own biases?\\nProbing:  Are we self-aware enough to do this sort of work, if you don\\'t have certain/specific training.  How often do you question the cultural appropriateness of what you say? \\n  Involving students in conflict resolution is key to making effective programs.  How can we encourage students who are disempowered to become invovled when they themselves may feel like nothing is in it for them?  \\'Good\\' kids vs. \\'bad\\' kids?\\nProbing:  Are we creating issues of division by doing this? ,\\n8,958,1,,\\n8,959,1,,\\n8,960,5,We are so excited for our presentation tomorrow on any app that we wanted to choose!

ScreenChomp and Educreations are pretty much the same, as well as a third one called ShowMe.\\n  Some differences I found among the three:\\n  - Educreations and ShowMe allow users to browse and stream videos uploaded by other creators, but ScreenChomp doesn\\'t (ouch!)\\n- Educreations allows you to call up a new page (and revisit old pages of drawings) while you record, and while simulating blank paper, lined paper, grid paper, and Cartesian coordinates, while the others don\\'t. Screenchomp\\'s drawing area is around three times bigger than the other two apps though.\\n- only ShowMe doesn\\'t allow you to import images from DropBox...could be a drawback for certain teachers\\n- only Educreations allows you to input text into your drawing. No idea why the other apps don\\'t have this function\\n- only Educreations\\'s brush is speed-sensitive (i.e. the faster your stroke, the thinner your ink, which emulates real ink on paper...nice aesthetic detail)\\n  So overall I\\'d definitely go with Educreations.\\n  However, if you want something more elaborate, Doceri is wicked cool.

Why do you think this is?  What do you think of this issue?  How can we overcome this barrier?\\n  The articles that we read all touch on the idea that the exclusion of individuals with disabilities stems from both the societal dialogue surrounding this issue and the fear of the uncertainty that often accompanies interactions with individuals who have a disability.  What can be done in the classroom to eliminate the fears students may have when it comes to a classmate with a disability?  What strategies can be used to best integrate these students into our classroom?  How can we change the dialogue used when discussing individuals with a disability?    ,\\n8,978,1,Hi everyone here are my questions for tomorrow:\\n    Discussion Questions:\\n1.     How are individuals with disabilities still segregated and/or “ignored” within both the educational system, including University, and society?\\n  2.     In thinking about the idea that a person HAS a disability, and is NOT a disabled person, how do you think the phrasing changes how those who do in fact have a disability are perceived?\\n  3.     In Kristeva’s article At the Limits of Living, she states that resisting racism, classist, and religious persecution has become “the sensible thing to do.”  However, when it comes to the exclusion of those suffering from a disability it is an entirely different story.  Do you think that this remains to be true? If so, how is it evident in the educational system both within the classroom and in the physical layout of educational facilities?\\n  4.     Do you think the term “disability” should be used? Does it create a negative connotation when referring to those that “suffer” from a disability? Finally, because disabilities occur in so many variations and are different from all others dependent on the person, should they be classified under this one, somewhat daunting, term?\\n  5.     According to Titchkosky, “… meanings of disability are generated through talk that justifies the exclusive shape and inaccessible structures of university life.”  Think about how the simplest adjustment in a phrase or definition about those who have a disability can change the way we support and/or provide the appropriate accessibility options for them.  Is this idea of the choice in wording an evident problem in our educational system? Why or why not?\\n  6.     Our interactions with others are some of the most important parts in developing a community, thus affecting society.  Many of the authors suggest that we need to rethink how we interact with those with disabilities and/or differences.  Do you believe this to be true? Furthermore, do you believe that we need to conduct a “rebirth of our thinking” in order for those with disabilities to be a part of society, not just integrated?    ,\\n8,979,1,I\\'ve sent my group this summary via email, but I wanted to post this before I left my house:\\n    1) The article: At the Limits of Living: To Joseph Grigely, argues that in order to understand different types of disabilities, we must take into account ideas that originate from psychoanalysis. The article first describes how a filmmaker created a documentary of how to best treat a schizophrenic patient. Although the documentary was successful (many people saw the film and the film was given awards), Julia Kristeva strongly feels that no new insight was found about how to treat schizophrenia as the film did not take into account the schizophrenic patient\\'s point of view. The author suggests that through understanding of unconsciousness, dreams and other psychoanalytical procedures we can better understand disabilities.\\n  Questions:\\na) Do you feel that consumerist actions (i.e. watching films) help people understand the nature of mental disabilities?\\nb) Do psychoanalytical techniques still play an important role in understanding mental disabilities?\\n\\n \\n2) In the article: Minds Between Us: Autism, Mindblindness and the Uncertainty of Communication, Anne E. McGuire & Rod Michalko discuss how autism is thought of as an enigma to the psyche. They strongly believe that this attempt to solve this mystery is the basis for how people treat autism. This idea of wanting to figure out what is missing in the mind stems from the psychological concepts of theory of mind (correlating mental states as predictors for behaviour) and mind-blindness (the deficiency of not predicting ones mental states and behaviour).The authors suggest that people should not think of autism in these concepts, but instead look at trying to understand autism through interactions and communication.\\n  Questions:\\n  a) Should we therefore study autism with a behaviourist approach (study observable behaviour) or should we follow the theory of mind?\\n  b) How can theory of mind and mind-blindness affect our teaching and our own understanding of autism?\\n    3) The third article: The Anguish of Power: Remapping Mental Diversity with an Anticolonial Compass looks at the World Health Organization\\'s (WHO) understanding and treatment of people with mental illness. The WHO\\'s definition of mental illness is whereby the psychological problem is organic in nature. Therefore, WHO believes that mental illness can be cured through treatment (i.e. medicine). However, WHO does not take into consideration various social issues (poverty, racism, unstable family environment). Furthermore, society in itself is not normalized and each country, city, region, have different poverty rates, domesticated areas, and family make-ups. WHO normalizes society when society is itself atypical.\\n    Questions:\\n  a) Are psychological disorders problems with mind, body or both, is treating the mind separate from treating the body?\\n  b) How strongly do you believe that social issues are correlated to mental illness?\\n        4) Although institutions are required to provide a space that is accessible to people with disabilities, the last article: To Pee or Not To Pee, states that even the most accessible places do exclude people with disabilities. As an excuse, people gauge in regular dialogue as a way of justifying why there are inaccessible areas. These excuses have become reasons for not making places accessible to all people. These moments of dialogue need to be looked at so we can better understand how to make places accessible for all such people.\\n  Questions\\na) How can this line of dialogue affect our teaching and school practices toward disabilities?,\\n8,980,2,Hey guys! \\nHere is my facilitation. \\n  If you are in my group... my printer broke and i do not have hard copies today.

(colonial literature, basically),\\n8,998,1,  Operationalizing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: A Synthesis of Classroom-Based Research\\nMorrison, Robbins, Rose (2008).\\n  This article is essentially a literature review of research into culturally relevant pedagogy.  The authors organized the articles according to the Ladson-Billings framework, which identifies three components of culturally relevant pedagogy: setting High Expectations, developing Cultural Competence, and developing Critical Consciousness.  The authors then examined 45 studies for specific pedagogical strategies that teachers used to achieve these components.  Morrison et al.’s study is a comprehensive base of strategies and tools teachers are using in developing a culturally relevant pedagogy; however, the authors acknowledge that most classrooms surveyed in the studies were culturally and racially homogeneous.  The teacher of a heterogeneous classroom may not find all such strategies useful.  The authors also expressed concerns over the observed challenges to schools, organizational structures, curriculum, and education, and called for changes in such spaces to permit more culturally relevant teaching.\\n  Building a Framework for Classroom-Based Multicultural Democratic Education: Learning From Three Skilled Teachers. Marri (2005).\\n  Marri’s primary research question investigates how three secondary social studies teachers “teach about and for multicultural democracy in their U.S. history courses”, and what factors “serve as obstacles in working toward classroom-based multicultural democracy” (p. 1037).  Marri’s framework is based on CMDE (classroom-based multicultural democratic education), the three parts of which are critical pedagogy, building a community, and thorough disciplinary content.  As part of their critical pedagogy and building a community, Marri observed the teachers reconceptualising the curriculum and building cooperative learning groups to model democracy; he also saw teachers providing students with “codes of power” in order to survive, then to challenge, expand, and change these codes.  Marri found that obstacles remained, some of them imposed by the teachers themselves through inadvertent privileging of diversity and using class homogeneity as an excuse.\\n  Performing the Problematics and Possibilities of Developing a Curriculum for Cultural Diversity.  Carson, Johnston, Richardson, Mangat, Tupper, Wiltse, Mgombelo (2003).\\n  This paper is (presumably) a transcript of a “performance” given at a 2003 conference.  Carson et al. discuss the tensions experienced by pre-service teachers between “multiculturalism as plan and multiculturalism as lived experience”, and while negotiating their personal and professional identities.  The centre of their discussion was a video (a “cultural artefact”) they produced intending to help educators “engage in empathetic inquiry into their own histories and cultural practices”; following this they described teacher perspectives around the video and implications thereof, particularly around that of whiteness and teaching.  Finally the researchers briefly examine observed tensions and resistances between ideology and engaged practice.\\n  Questions\\n“Learning to teach is a negotiatory process.  The way we imagine that we will teach as we are preparing to enter the classroom is not necessarily reflected in the way we actually teach.”  We talk about these survival shoes a lot in teacher education – how much of this is a copout?\\nIs cultural difference, or a culturally relevant pedagogy, a mere matter of developing techniques and tools?   \\nWhat’s the difference between multicultural and anti-racist education?  Is there a difference?  Should there be a difference? \\nDo you agree with Morrison et al. that heterogeneous classrooms inherently invite a different pedagogy than homogeneous classrooms?\\nWhat do you make of these “codes of power”? ,\\n8,999,1,Morrison, K.

Equity & Excellence in Education,            41(4), 433â€?452.\\n  The authors review forty-five articles to take stock of how Gloria’s Ladson Billings’ theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP) is being implemented. The findings are divided by the three main components of CRP according to Ladson Billings (High Expectations, Cultural Competence and Critical Consciousness). The authors draw from the research to explain how each of these goals is pursued by reporting on teachers’ actions in the classroom that illustrate this. They pose two questions in response to gaps in the research they reviewed. First, how do teachers operationalize CRP in classes that are heterogeneous (the great majority of research reviewed dealt with culturally and ethnically homogenous groups)? Second, how can CRP (which is necessarily disruptive of hegemony) be operationalized in educational environments that are organized in ways that perpetuate hegemony?\\n  Richardson, G., & al, e. (2003). Performing the problematics and possibilities of developing a            curriculum for cultural diversity. Educational Insights, 8(2).\\n  The authors discuss new teachers’ experiences in integrating cultural diversity theory with their teaching practice. The conversation attempts to investigate the spaces in between real and ideal, where it comes to practice and identity, to understand how teachers form ‘lived’, dynamic  curricula from formal plans and institutional demands. The discussion raises the question: ‘what is the relationship between ‘being’ and ‘doing’ in cultural diversity education?’ in relationship to the positionalities of student teachers. It uncovers some of the biases held by people learning to teach, as well as gaps in teacher education around diversity issues. The conversation concludes with the concept of the ‘undecidablility’ of teaching; a notion that troubles the search for ‘best practices’ and definitive answers to complex questions.\\n  Marri, A. R. (2005). Building a framework for classroomâ€?based multicultural democratic      education: Learning from three skilled teachers. 107(7), 1036â€?1059.\\n  This article addresses the challenges in teaching for multicultural democracy through observations of and discussions with three high school social science teachers. The author is interested in how these teachers work to prepare their students for civic participation by going ‘beyond the curriculum’ to address critically engage students around issues like participation, power and privilege. A theoretical framework, called Classroom-based Multicultural Democratic Education (CMDE),  brings together “critical pedagogy, building of community, and thorough disciplinary content” and is put forward as a means of approaching quality multicultural democratic education. The article also discusses obstacles to successful CMDE, concluding that despite the seeming effectiveness of the teacher’s work, further studies are needed to examine the long-term impact of the work in engaging traditionally disengaged populations.\\n    Thinking of the populations of students that you may realistically be working with one day, what ‘gaps’ exist in your cultural understanding/knowledge?\\nWhat do are some of the messages that you want to bring to your teaching, in terms of culture? What are the ‘big ideas’ (pardon the expression) that you will have students thinking about?\\nDo you feel politically engaged? Is it important that your future students feel that way, or have foundational knowledge/skills/attitudes that will allow them to be later in life?\\nHow would/would the specific makeup of your class affect your approach to issues of diversity education?,\\n8,1000,1,Here it is!,\\n8,1001,1,,\\n8,1002,1,1. Legal Lens:\\n    There are a variety of applicable regulations and sub-sections which apply to this case study.  Below are a sampling, although there may be others which also apply.  According to Education Act Section 264(1) e: “It is the duty of the teacher and temporary teacher (e) to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline in the teacher’s classroom and while on duty in the school and on the school ground.”  Additionally, Education Act Section 265(1), Duties of Principal – discipline – a, - indicates that they are to “to maintain proper order and discipline in the school.”  Ontario Regulation 298, Duties of Principals 11(3)(e) goes on to say that they are to “provide for the supervision of pupils during the period of time during each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils” whereas the specific duties of teachers is laid out in Duties of Teachers – 20 – b - where it indicates teachers are to “carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require” and g, “ensure that all reasonable safety procedures are carried out in courses and activities for which the teacher is responsible.”  The school board policy issue would be specific to the particular board.  According to the Waterloo District School Board, for example, Administrative Procedure 1370 “Responsibility for Maintaining Safety, Security, and Order in the School Environment”\\n (http://staff.wrdsb.ca/policyprocedure/files/2012/07/AP1370-Safe-Secure-Order-in-School1.pdf) clearly articulates the supervisory functions of principals and of teachers in the school environment.\\n    2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens:\\n  Different boards have varying policies but consistently they do have that is specifically addressing issues of diversity.  For instance, the Toronto District School Board has an Anti-Racism and Ethnocultural Equity Policy which states the following: ”The Board shall provide an appropriate mechanism to ensure accountability for achieving these goals by:\\n….ensuring that educational practices are inclusive and reflect the contributions of diverse cultures, and that all forms of stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, racism, and violence against Aboriginal, racial, ethnocultural, and faith communities are challenged and eliminated.”  As this example policy indicates that the board SHALL provide an appropriate mechanism, it would depend slightly on what the board had actually determined to be that mechanism and where the accountability lay, whether at an administrative or a practitioner (ie, teacher) level. \\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens\\n  According to the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT), the baseline ethical standards for the teaching profession are care, respect, trust and integrity.  Unfortunately, you can be acting in an ethical fashion while not necessarily adhering to the legal requirements.  In this particular case study, there was a difference between the ethics of care (ie, helping out students) versus meeting professional legal requirements for supervision.  While the teachers actions were not unethical, there was still an element of negligence.  As such, the question for teachers should not only be “am I acting in an ethical fashion?” but also where there are competing demands, “prior to meeting any additional commitments to students, have I carried out my baseline job requirements?”  Additionally, number 11 of OCT’s Misconduct Regulation states that “failing to supervise adequately a person who is under the professional supervision of the member” is an act of misconduct. \\n   ,\\n8,1003,1,1. A Legal Lens\\n    According to Ontario Regulation 298, Duties of Principals 11(3) (e),  the principal must “provide for the supervision of pupils during the period of time during each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils.” Furthermore, Duties of Teachers (20) indicates they must (e) “assist the principal in maintaining close co-operation with the community” and (h) “co-operate with the principal and other teachers to establish and maintain consistent disciplinary practices in the school.”  As such, both the supervisory aspect and the teacher’s collaboration with the principal are clearly supported by policy.  Whether or not the seizer is legal, however, is a slightly different discussion.\\nAccording to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Legal Rights – Search or seizure -  “everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.”  The key question then becomes whether or not the search was unreasonable.  Without a more thorough background in law, that determination is extremely difficult for at teacher to know.   Additional guidance can be found in the Ontario Ministry of Education Provincial Code of Conduct and School Board Codes of Conduct.  Specifically, they strongly discourage the use of alcohol and illegal drugs, both in Subsection 301 (2)  - #6, and in Standards of Behaviour – Safety, in which it states that “all members of the school community must not traffic weapons or illegal drugs; be in possession of, or be under the influence of, or provide others with alcohol or illegal drugs “ and finally in subsection Suspension “Possessing alcohol or illegal drugs”. \\n  2. A Professional Ethics Lens\\n    According to the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT), the baseline ethical standards for the teaching profession are care, respect, trust and integrity.  All four are closely linked to this case study.  There is the very real possibility that there was no drug deal occurring, in which both perceived case and respect for the students could be compromised. Additionally, the question of what you are trying to accomplish by a drug raid must also be raised.  Although it is illegal in any given case, why are you honing in on these particular students?  Is there a reason which may compromise your perceived integrity, such as their identity as a particular marginalized group?  Additionally, consequences are never equal; some people are better equipped to deal with the legal and emotional ramifications of a drug ‘bust.’  In conducting such a raid, are you also prepared to provide the supports which would allow the raid to lead to ch6ange, or is it only likely to lead to arrest, cessation of schooling to that point, and disproportionate consequences later in life?  Am I treating this student in the same way I would any other in my consideration of all factors/active pursuit of \"catching\" this act through active seizer/search?,\\n8,1004,1,1. Legal Lens\\n    First of all, the case is unclear.  Did one student have both a bleeding forehead and a possible concussion, or did one student have a bleeding forehead and the other a concussion?  The teacher is responsible for all of the students under her supervision.  According to Education Act Section 264(1), Duties of Teacher - Care of pupils and property  “It is the duty of the teacher (j) to give assiduous attention to the health and comfort of the pupils.”  Additionally, Duties of Teachers 20 indicates that teachers will (b) “carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require” as well as (g) “ensure that all reasonable safety procedures are carried out in courses and activities for which the teacher is responsible.”   The question is not only did the teacher follow her responsibilities in the TRAUMA CARE of the injured students, but also whether she carried out her duties in the PREVENTION of harm.  Were there safety procedures in place which were ignored?  Additionally, the role of the principal is important, as according to Ontario Regulation 298, Duties of Principals 11(3)(e), the principal shall “ provide for the supervision of pupils during the period of time during each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils.” Both appear to have followed the letter of their duties but that does not ensure that there would be no cause to claim negligence. \\n  2. \\n  When the school building and grounds are open to pupils they congregate pupils together who otherwise would not likely be in each other’s company.  As such, there is an opportunity for conflict created that they otherwise would  not be exposed to.  In creating clear expectations around the supervision of students in that context, the possible conflicts which can arise by bringing together a diverse student population is minimized and the likelihood that they will have a safe learning environment is improved. \\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\\n  According to the four point model of the Ontario College of Teachers (care, integrity, trust and respect) this case did not have particular clear ramifications beyond the obvious need of teachers to care for their students’ well being. \\n ,\\n8,1005,3,  Hello Everyone, \\n  I hope everyone is having a delightful weekend. Because it takes a bit of effort to find these articles online, I made an effort to locate them and post them here. Hope it helps - and sorry for the delay. \\n    Morrison, K. A., Robbins, H. H., & Rose, D. G. (2008). Operationalizing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: A Synthesis of Classroomâ€?Based Research. Equity & Excellence in Education, 41(4), 433â€?452.\\nMorrison, Robbins and Rose use forty five classroom-based research studies to examine the modes for developing culturally relevant pedagogy. They explore three major themes that emerge from their review of these studies, including: High Academic Expectations; Cultural; Competence; Critical Consciousness. Although their research appears to “assist preservice teachers, experienced teachers, and teacher educators in developing a more holistic understanding of what culturally relevant pedagogy “looks like” in classrooms” - they simply list a number of differing strategies, while toting the idea that difference must be taught in a way that is mindful of the heterogenous needs of students. \\n  Discussion Questions:\\n“We do not intend to imply that culturally relevant teaching is a “methods fetish” (Bartolome, 1994, p. 173) or a prescribed set of instructional moves.\" What does culturally relevant teaching look and feel like to you? How do you interpret the differences in Critical Thinking Pedagogy and Culturally relevant Teaching?\\n“Culturally relevant pedagogy ultimately clashes with the traditional ways in which education is carried out in our society, thus making culturally relevant teaching actions seem herculean to many teachers. Piaget (1969) stated that “the heartbreaking difficulty in pedagogy, as indeed in medicine and other branches of knowledge that partake at the same time of art and science, is, in fact, that the best methods are also the most difficult ones” (p. 69).” Do you feel this is an accurate depiction? Are you confident in your ability to teach culturally relevant pedagogy? Explain. \\nRichardson, G., & al, e. (2003). Performing the problematics and possibilities of developing a curriculum for cultural diversity. Educational Insights, 8(2).\\nThis reading, by Richardson (et. al) is a performance consisting of five linked scenes. Richardson describes how “each scene attempts to represent a different aspect of developing a curriculum for cultural diversity in teacher education curriculum”. Effectively, this text is a dialogue between teacher educators’ intentions and student teachers’ voices.  This “performance” juxtaposes theory and the dilemmas of culturally relevant teaching, as well as the difficulty of teaching teachers to teach something they don’t necessarily know how to engage with. Moreover, it describes teaching as an act of negotiation, where teaching is dependent on the saying and the doing that the teacher negotiates through. \\nDiscussion Questions:\\n“I see there’s a kind of cultural blindness at work here that suggests that minorities have “culture”but that the mainstream does not.” In a school such as VOICE, where there is a lack of visible minorities in the classroom - how would you combat \"cultural blindness\" in your classroom or pedogogy?\\n“Ideology depends upon this gap between knowing that there is a law and not knowing the exact regulations. As Zizek says, it is the tragic fate of the subject to “be held hostage to the word,”“to a priori guilty ... in his very existence guilty without knowing why”(p.14).” Have you ever felt uncomfortable pushing for or developing lessons that incorporated difficult subjects? Do you agree with Zizek\\'s claim regarding school ideologies?\\n“The way that we imagine that we will teach as we are preparing to enter the classroom is not necessarily reflected in the way we actually teach. Rather, it is a process of constant negotiation and mediation.” The Masters in Teaching program is VERY reflective, yet, much of it, especially at the end of the year can be just reflecting for the sake of others, rather than an in-depth personal examination - Do you agree with this passage, and realistically, do you see reflection and negotiation as a part of your personal development as a teacher?\\n  Marri, A. R. (2005). Building a framework for classroomâ€?based multicultural democratic education: Learning from three skilled teachers. 107(7), 1036â€?1059.\\nThis study investigates how three “skilled” secondary social studies teachers taught about and for multicultural democracy, which asks both (a)Who is and is not participating in democracy and on whose terms? And, (b) How wide is the path to participation? The article considers their pedagogy and philosophies about teaching to the “codes of power” and skills for effective citizenship. It also illustrated how the teachers attempted to bridge transformative academic knowledge and traditional academic knowledge. Furthermore, Marri presents an in-depth discussion of “critical pedagogy” and teaching to “social action”. Marri also describes that despite being skilled teachers, none of the participants within the study were able to extend their teaching to include individual or collective social action.\\nDiscussion Questions:\\n  Marri explains the discrepancy between transformative academic knowledge versus traditional academic knowledge - how do you see these two categories play out in your own experience of negotiating your space or personal identity ?\\n“I was struck by the difference between the theory and the actual practice of these three excellent teachers in teaching about and for multicultural democracy. This lack of evidence may mean that such teaching, as currently defined in the literature, may not be necessary for promoting human agency or for social transformation for these three teachers.” The other day, during the Math Social Justice lesson, Aaron explained that he was frustrated by the lack of social action that happens in classrooms - have you witnessed a successful social action task in your placement schools?\\n“Even in homogenous classrooms, based on race, class, or gender, teachers can create cooperative groups that allow students to be seen as individuals, instead of as representatives, of a specific group” Have you ever caught yourself teaching to a stereotype, instead of to the individuals in front of you? \\nHave these readings changed your perception of culturally relevant teaching? If so, how? If not, why? Explain. \\nSee you tomorrow!\\nAlexia,\\n8,1006,1,1. Legal Lens:\\n  1a) Ms.Mark\\'s Responsibilities\\n  According to policy/program memorandum #145 “all employees of the board are required to report serious student incident to the principal” and “board employees who work directly with students...are required to respond to incidents that may have a negative impact on the school climate.”  Ms.Marks, therefore, does not have discretion – she is obligated to report the incident to her principal.\\n  1b) Steps with Kayla, Ally, and Jay:\\n    According to the Education Act 306.  (1),   ‘a principal shall consider whether to suspend a pupil if he or she believes that the pupil has engaged in any of the following activities while ….in … circumstances where engaging in the activity will have an impact on the school climate” which include (6) “bullying.’’  As such, suspension is an option that the principal can consider if he/she deems it appropriate.  However, there is a certain level of discretion given to the principal as suspension is not MANDATED in this particular case. Depending on the situation, a discussion, community circle, official reprimand or public apology alongside a public presentation on cyberbullying by the offenders, amongst other other options, may be more appropriate. \\n  1c.  Steps with Sandy\\n    According to Policy/Program Memorandum #145, “principals are required to notify the parents of students who are victims of serious student incidents unless, in the principal\\'s opinion, notification of the parents would put the student at risk of being harmed by the parents” and, “where the parents are not notified, supports must be provided for these students.”  What is unclear is if any support to the victim is appropriate when the parents have in fact been notified.  In any case, this will impact the school learning environment for this student so some sort of support or school-based redress is undoubtedly appropriate even if not mandated.\\n  d) Teacher Role with Technology\\n  While cyber bullying or other uses of technology may occur outside of the school,that does not necessarily mean that there is no role for school staff. Increasingly Ontario boards have policies governing the school’s role in technology outside of the school which nonetheless impacts the school climate.  As per question b, above, “According to the Education Act 306.  (1),   ‘a principal shall consider whether to suspend a pupil if he or she believes that the pupil has engaged in any of the following activities while ….in … circumstances where engaging in the activity will have an impact on the school climate: .....6. Bullying.’’ \\n    2. An Equity Diversity, and Social Justice Lens:\\n  2a)\\n  Kayla has essentially been victimized in two ways: firstly, by the betrayal through the hijacking of her account by her supposed ‘friends’; secondly, as her overall reputation has been slandered as someone who would dare to ask a boy out rather than observing traditional gender roles.\\nRegardless of whether Kayla would or would not observe those roles, the latter victimization would not be as severe if her reputation were not also compromised.  A response that focused not only on the integrity of her electronic accounts but also on the ridiculousness of bullying based on adherence to traditional dating gender roles could also mitigate the damage to Kayla, but also to those girls who truly did ask out their dates and do not deserve to be ridiculed for their assertiveness.\\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\\n  3a) Professional Development Expectations\\nAlthough legislation is a provincial jurisdiction, normally changes in legislation are accompanied by corresponding changes in school board level directives and policies.  Additionally, professional development tends to be the jurisdiction of the individual school boards.  Given that overall context, teachers can expect that any professional development may lag considerably behind changes in legislation.  As such, teachers can “expect” little, and what they do receive they can expect to be slightly out of date or at least to lag behind the actual changes in legislation.\\n  3b) OCT Stands w.r.t. Case\\n  The standards of the teaching profession include care, respect, trust, and integrity.  In particular, this case requires that care for students and integrity with respect to our own privileged role in students lives are acknowledged.  As teachers, we are in a position to learn a great deal of the going-ons in students lives which may not be readily apparent to other adults in their lives and to act upon that information in a fashion cognisant of the massive impact electronic communication plays in students social lives.\\n     ,\\n8,1007,1,1. Legal Lens:\\n  1a) \"Slurring\" Student Discipline\\n  According to the Education Act 310 (3), the ...” a principal may suspend a pupil under this section for up to 20 school days.’’  However, there is no requirement to do so.  There are significant potential lifelong consequences to 20 days of lost high school days of schooling which have a major academic impact which would ideally be avoided, particularly if the student was not strong academically and able to make up the time easily.  Such a consequences could reasonably be a factor in later drop out and lack of completion of high school, directly going against the mandate of the Ontario Ministry of Education.  As such, as public a response as possible to indicate the seriousness of homophobia, which ideally providing the student some way to redress the wrong done, would be a preferred method.\\n  1b) Tricia Disclipining:\\n    According to Education Act 310 (3), the ...” principal may suspend a pupil under this section for up to 20 school days and, in considering how long the suspension should be, the principal shall take into account any mitigating or other factors prescribed by the regulations.’’  The slur was made in such a public forum that a lack of response by Tricia would almost undoubtedly be seen as an acceptance of the identity, or provide fuel for further bullying at a later date, leaving her in a precarious position no matter what course of action she chose.  While her violent response is not condonable, it is certainly a different situation than someone who actively attempts to publically humiliate someone. \\n  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens:\\n  2a) Addressing the Incident\\n  This incident actually contains two separate issues, homophobia, and appropriate responses to conflict.  For the former, explicitly addressing why ‘lesbian’ is that even considered an insult, do lesbians even have a particular “look” that this could conceivably even be a true statement?  What if she WAS lesbian, why would that be an insult?  Or is this about levering hate speech – in this case, homophobic - against someone he didn’t like? Secondly, is violence ever the way to respond to conflict?  What does an alternative look like? Where was this coming from (ie, an unknown, an ongoing bullying, etc)\\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\\n  3a) Gay/Straight Alliance\\n    I would highly doubt that this conflict actually arose because the girl was truly perceived to be a lesbian and the individual truly felt that was an important issue.  It appears much more likely that it was simply used as a slur against someone he didn’t care for.  Given that issue, a gay-straight alliance might be in a position to improve understandings of sexual orientation, particular as it pertains to constructed gendered identities as being separate from sexual preference.  As this particular incident seems less like a targeted hate speech and more like opportunistic bullying, it could perhaps open a space for a conversation on the impacts that such speech can have on those who truly are the target group.,\\n8,1008,1,  (I) Building a Framework for Classroom-Based Multicultural Democratic Education: Learning From Three Skilled Teachers, Marri (2005)\\n            “There exists a gap between multicultural and democratic education when addressing the question of how to educate members for democracy in a multicultural society”.  Such a gap creates a disengaged population, which is itself socioeconomically, culturally, and politically diverse.  The framework proposed by Marri, 2005 aims to involve such a population, and create “thoughtful, active, and effective citizens”. \\n            The framework, termed Classroom-Based Multicultural Democratic Education (CMDE), has three key elements: critical pedagogy, building of community, and thorough disciplinary content.  It means teaching students “codes of power”, or the rules that one must follow to be successful in society, but also to critically question the norms, from different perspectives, and be able to properly communicate and debate these issues with other informed citizens.  It means extending the curriculum past the traditional content to include diverse groups that are normally excluded.\\n            It also means reflecting the demographic of the students in the classroom, and sharing multiple and critical perspectives.  It means including all forms of diversity, such as race and ethnicity, gender, sexual, religious, linguistic, socioeconomic diversity, etc., in order to not marginalize certain groups.  Lastly, as stated in the article, it means not only critical thinking, but social and group action to put the theory into practice.\\n            “The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover ways in which to transform a racially and ethnically diverse, politically disengaged population into a thoughtful, active, and effective citizenry”.  The applications of incorporating such a framework throughout the whole curriculum, and across multiple grade levels are practical for teachers.  It only requires them to be aware that such a framework exists, that it is itself practical, and that they can adopt and adapt it as their own. \\n  Questions\\n1)   If the three teachers in the Marri, 2005 study, who were known for incorporating multicultural democratic education into their classrooms, couldn’t get it completely right (lack of promotion of social action, limited conceptions of diversity, and lack of classroom context), what hope is there for us, or for the “average” teachers?  Is there necessarily a “right” way?\\n2)   As teachers, it is our job to teach the official, as well as the “hidden” curriculum.  Is it practical to expect that each teacher, in the amount of time they have, should be/or even can address all this content?\\n3)   What is “diversity”?  If certain groups are not present in our classrooms, is it still necessary to include them in our discourse, even if we should be relating the content to the students themselves who are present?  Is this part of critical pedagogy?\\n  (II) Performing the Problematic and Possibilities of Developing a Curriculum for Cultural Diversity, Richardson et al. (2003)\\n            There exists a tension between saying and doing.  Talking about the best practice of anti-racist and multicultural education, for example, does not necessarily translate to the classroom as one might hope, once teachers are expected to “wear clothes” that may not necessarily fit each person’s ideology.\\n            Student teachers, as well as their students, must be given the opportunity to question their own cultural identities, even if those identities may be likened to association by non-association, or by “whiteness”.  Cultural diversity is normally equated to a minority trait, and this prolongs the norm where everything else other than the mainstream is considered multicultural.  This enforces some student teachers’ ideas around cultural difference as being: the externalized other, as a pedagogical technique, or as a threatening presence. \\n            Cultural differences should be understood as lived experiences, as everyone speaks from a cultural location.  We are primed to believe that the idea of “whiteness”, which is present in the “hidden” curriculum, addresses the mainstream lived experiences, and that anything else is just multicultural.  This marginalizes the “other”.  It denies their existence in the mainstream, and prolongs the stereotyping of them as “other”, and not part of the whole.  This is only possible by watering down the conception of “whiteness”, and making it culturally indistinguishable, to the point where it cannot be explained.  It is bound to the unconscious mind.  It, then, can only be defined in relation to the “other”.  Curriculum reinforces this idea.\\n  Questions\\n1)   How do you, as pre-service teachers, understand cultural differences?\\n2)   How does the Ontario Curriculum view anti-racism and multicultural education?  Is the “hidden” curriculum exclusive or inclusive of the “other”?  Does it view everyone as culturally different, based on lived experiences?\\n  (III) Operationalizing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: A Synthesis of Classroom-Based Research, Morrison et al. (2008)\\n            As school enrolment is projected to see children from diverse cultural groups, it becomes more and more apparent that education must change in order to ensure student success.  Culturally relevant pedagogy, which addresses the students’ language, cultural, and language backgrounds, may be the answer.  Morrison et al. (2008) studied how teachers optimized the use of culturally relevant pedagogy in their classroom, and offer an extensive review of best practices found in 45 past studies.\\n            “First, culturally relevant teaching emphasizes academic success for all students (High Expectations). Second, culturally relevant teaching assists students in the formation of a positive cultural identity (Cultural Competence). Finally, culturally relevant teaching guides students in developing a critical consciousness that they can use to critique or interrupt current and historical social inequities (Critical Consciousness)”.  A lot of the strategies listed are echoed in the last two articles.\\n            The study also highlights some “conundrums” when it comes to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in the classroom, for pre-service, as well as experienced teachers.  The current traditional structure of schooling favours transmission of knowledge to suit standardized testing and curriculum expectations.  This leads to a more teacher-directed approach, as oppose to a student-centered one, which contradicts good culturally relevant pedagogy.  More time is required to do it right, and in order to hit all the dimensions of such a pedagogy, teachers need more time and resources to get to know the students, their families, and their communities, and how their needs can be best met.\\n            If we are to give students the equitable education they deserve, teachers must allow students involvement in the curriculum in order to engage them in their own schooling.

In text and art, they provide an overview of three systems of measurement; half the book is dedicated to the origins of the ancient Egyptian digits, palms, spans, and cubits, as well as Roman paces. The second half turns to the customary and metric systems in use today. Inches, feet, yards, and miles are briefly explained, with comparisons to metric units, from millimeters to dekameters. Wide-eyed cartoon figures are superimposed against cinematic montages of rulers and grids in an eye-catching format; after children have fallen down laughing over Math Curse (1995), this volume offers them practical tools.\\nSource: (Editorial Review - Kirkus Reviews)\\nThe lesson:\\n·         Hook: Start discussion with “Today I travelled X cubits to school” where 1 cubit = 45cm. Integrate another fact, such as “The CN tower is 378 yards high, which is quite taller than me, since I am about 2 yards high”. Ask students if they can imagine/visualize what these lengths mean. This should create a healthy amount of confusion.\\n·         The lesson should begin with a discussion of known measurement systems. This activity can be done via “think, pair, share” or as a class with the volunteered answers written on the board.\\no   Leading questions:\\n§  “What is that system based on?” so that students can think of how the arbitrary measurement system came to be.\\n§  “What do you think they used to measure pyramids?” so students can speculate about a common measuring tool.\\n·         The next step is to have students think about how measuring systems are devised. Ask students “If you were to create your own measurement system, what would it be based on?”. Think, pair, share for 5 minutes or less.\\n·         At this stage, students should read the parts of the book dedicated to the Egyptian system and the imperial system. Students should not read the part of the book about the metric system, as it is beneficial that the teacher be the one to teach it with the assistance of the book.\\n·         Ask students at what temperature water boils and at what temperature it freezes. Explain that 0 degrees and 100 degrees are very round numbers, and very convenient. Explain that the Celcius system of measuring temperatures was just fixed to those numbers. Before that, temperature was measured in other ways.\\n·         Introduce idea that the metric measurement system is also based on water.\\n·         Discuss with elbow partners why we have chosen water to be the base of our measurement systems. (To guide students, the instructor may want to say: “I don’t think forearms are a good measure.” and line up their forearm with a student’s. “Why doesn’t that work well?”\\n·         E.g. “If Mr.  %InstructorName% decides to build a house along with %Student’sName%, and they start working on two separate parts of the house, then that house will be crooked! Why?”\\n·         Answer to why water was chosen: All humans have water in common, and water is not different from person to person and place to place. Thus, it can be a universal measure.\\n·         Explain to students how we derive volume from water, and then extend the explanation to length.\\n   ,\\n8,1033,1,http://www.nytimes.com/video/2013/01/22/opinion/100000002020130/gospel-of-intolerance.html?smid=fb-share ,\\n8,1034,1,As promised in the presentation, the livebinder of bookmarks related to Anxiety/Depression: \\nhttp://www.livebinders.com/play/play?id=763881\\n  I left it \"public\" so if you\\'re aware of other resources please feel free to add to them!,\\n8,1035,1,,\\n8,1036,1,Note the \"Beyond Facts and Acts\" is bigger than the reading - it starts on p.50.,\\n8,1037,1,Hm...one of the commenters left this: \"We need a return to concrete algorithmic basics like the JUMP Math program offers.\"\\n  At my practicum school, my grade 6 class splits up into a \"advanced math\" (their performance ranges from grade 6 to 9 level) and \"standard math\" (all math anxious, struggling with grade 5/6 level math).

I\\'m sure school culture has something to do with it too, but on the Friday observation day, after my AT and I taught them how to add fractions with different denominators, they were somehow really excited about math and even stayed behind during recess to teach each other in front of the SMARTboard, no joke.\\n  It seems that the only real difference between JUMP Math and textbooks out there is that JUMP leaves absolutely no stone unturned with pretty much every single skill, which I imagine makes math concepts a lot easier to follow/process/absorb (and overall more approachable).

A Legal Lens: What do the statutes, regulations, memoranda and school district policies say on this case?\\n              Based on the statues, regulations, memoranda, and school district policies, it is clear that both the teacher and the principal did not fulfill their duties. According to the Education Act, it states under section 264(e) that one of the duties of a teacher is \"to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline in the teacher’s classroom and while on duty in the school and on the school ground\". Furthermore, regulation 298 (20) states that one of the duties of a teacher is to \"carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require\". In order for the teacher to maintain such discipline and provide information to the principal, the teacher must follow the duty schedule. Although the teacher is helping students inside the classroom, the teacher is obligated to supervise the cafeteria as the duty schedule had stated. Unless the principal gave clear instructions to the teacher to help students after class, the teacher would be obliged by law to fulfill the supervisory duties as teacher. Also, the teacher would not be able to report to the principal as he/she was not performing his/her duty.\\n            The principal would also be held accountable for the teacher being late for his/her supervisory duty as the education act section 265 states that the principal is responsible \"to maintain proper order and discipline in the school\". Also, regulation 298 (11) states that it is the principal\\'s responsibility to \"provide for the supervision of pupils during the period of time during each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils\". Therefore, by not having the teacher in his supervisory role, the principal failed to meet the duties and responsibilities of a principal. Both the teacher and principal would be accountable for this incident according to these legal acts.\\n  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: If the incident was initiated by a racist comment or act what responsibilities would a school board take into consideration?\\n              A school board would want to know about which student said the racist comment and why the comment was said. School boards have policies for equity and social justice issues. For example, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has the Anti-Racism and Ethnocultural equity policy that requires all schools have \"educational practices [that] are inclusive and reflect the contributions of diverse cultures, and that all forms of stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, racism, and violence against Aboriginal, racial, ethnocultural, and faith communities are challenged and eliminated\". A school board would thus want to talk to both the principal and the supervisory teacher to gain insight about the incident and how such comments can be abolished.  However, with the teacher not being present in the cafeteria compounds the issue. The school board would have a difficult time eliminating such comments if teachers are not fulfilling their supervisory duties and stopping the fight before it escalated. One of the rights that a principal has, according to Ontario Regulation 298, is to recommend to a school board whether to demote or dismiss the teacher. If the principal goes to a school board and explains to them about the incident and requests that the teacher was not on duty as instructed, the school board would likely dismiss the teacher due to the teacher not meeting any equity policies.\\n            3. A Professional Ethics Lens: As a member of the College of Teachers you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, explore the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards.\\n                 According the Ontario College of Teachers, this teacher demonstrated professional misconduct by \"failing to supervise adequately a person who is under the professional supervision of the member\". This neglect of his/her duties resulted in two students getting into a fight and serious injuries to the student body. By not fulfilling ones duty of supervising the students, the teacher does not demonstrate the ethical standard of care. To care is to ensure the well-being of students and in this case, the teacher could not ensure the students well being when he/she failed to perform his/her duty (and in this case did not do so as there were injuries). These injuries could have been prevented if the teacher was their during ones duty. If the incident was caused by a racist remark, the teacher would also not meet the ethical standard of respect due to not modelling social justice and the emotional wellness of students. This incident could (and will) lead to lack of trust and integrity among other teachers, the principal, and most importantly the students. Also, this teacher must also oblige the standards and practices of the teaching profession. This incident shows that the teacher is not committed to students as he/she did not perform his/her duty. Lastly, the teacher needed to demonstrate that he/she is a leader in the school and professional knowledge. By not performing one\\'s duty failed to show commitment to the needs of the students and demonstrated poor leadership.,\\n8,1041,1,1. A Legal Lens: What do the statutes, regulations, memoranda and school district policies say on this case?\\n  In this particular case, the teacher observing these two students is acting appropriately. Based on the Education Act Regulation 298 (20), teachers are responsible to \"carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require\". Therefore, telling the vice-principal about what the teacher saw was required and ethical. In terms of the search, according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms section 8, \"everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure\" and the students could argue that their rights are being violated. However, the vice-principal feels that she has a reasonable cause for conducting a search of the student. Based on the Provincial Code of Conduct and the School Board Codes of Conduct, both teachers and principals are responsible by law \"to ensure the safety of the student body\"; which includes that they are responsible for not promoting the trafficking and use of illegal drugs. Therefore, principals can (if they so choose) call the police and determine whether this exchange warrants a criminal investigation. Furthermore, principals have the right to considering suspending the student if they believe they are committing a crime and are allowed to investigate the matter further.\\n  2. A Professional Ethics Lens: As a member of the College of Teachers you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, explore the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards.\\n  As a member of the Ontario College of Teachers, teachers are to ensure that the ethical standards of care, respect, trust, and integrity are met. Although I do believe that the vice-principal is right, I think that the vice-principal could have first asked the students about the exchange first before searching the students. By asking the student first, the vice-principal and teacher would be ensuring the trust of all members of the school community (i.e. parents/guardians wondering why was a search conducted?). Although the vice-principal and teacher are trying to meet the four ethical standards (as they want all students to safe and are doing what they feel is best for them), I feel that being honest and fair-minded is also important as well. By simply asking the student first about whether or not there had been a drug exchange, the vice-principal and teacher are showing openness and honestly. While I do not disagree with the search as they feel that there is a reasonable cause, being open about ones intention is just as important.\\nAs a teacher who must follow the standards and practices of the teaching profession, each teacher must show professional practice and knowledge. In this case, both vice-principal and teacher are demonstrating professional knowledge as they are using legislation to guide their reasons for a search. However, professional practice means that one must use appropriate methods when demonstrating professionalism (which includes responding to the needs of school community). Therefore, perhaps asking the student before the search would have been better practice. This could be done upon further reflection (a practice that all teachers must do).,\\n8,1043,1,1. A Legal Lens: What do the statutes, regulations, memoranda and school district policies say on this case?\\n  According to the Education Act section 265, the principal is responsible \"for maintaining proper order and discipline of the entire school\" along with the attentive health of all students. Since it is the teachers responsibility, according to section 264 of the education act, \"to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline while on duty on school grounds\", the teacher is also responsible for the health and safety of these students. Furthermore, the Ontario Regulation 298 states \"that teachers are responsible to ensure that all safety procedures are enforced both inside and outside of the classroom\". In this case, this activity was clearly unsafe due to the activity itself. If the students were \"vigorously\" playing foot hockey, they are likely to be extremely competitive. This competitiveness resulted in two students banging in to each other. This activity was also unsafe since they were playing on asphalt. Asphalt is a very hard surface and could cause serious injury if a student were to fall. This case study clearly shows that the student crashed into the asphalt wall resulting in an injury. With the activity being extremely energetic and surface area being unsafe itself, the teacher should not have allowed these grade 3 year olds to play foot hockey. The teacher was undoubtedly not playing attention and is responsible for their injuries.\\n  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: In your view, why is it important for students that administrators and teachers abide by Ontario Regulation 298, 11(3)(e)?\\n  Teachers should follow this regulation because it is their responsibility to act \"in loco parentis\". This means that teachers are supposed to treat each student as if they were our child. It is the teacher\\'s duty to protect every student in our care and students should feel safe and secure when they leave their parents/guardians and come into the school. When a parent sends their child to school, they expect that the child will be returned to them safely (both physically and emotionally). When students are playing outside during recess and lunch, there is a chance that students will become injured or hurt. Therefore, it is the teachers responsibility to actively watch over students so they will return to their parents/guardians in the same condition as they left them.\\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens: As a member of the College of Teachers you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, explore the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards.\\n  After viewing this case, it is clear that this teacher did not show the ethical standard of care and trust while on duty. Care is shown by teachers when the teacher demonstrates interest in the student\\'s well-being and if a teacher does not realize the potential danger of an activity and watches a student injure him/herself, then it is clear that the teacher has broken this ethical standard. Furthermore, the teacher broke the ethical standard of trust since the principal may feel that the teacher is not responsible enough to carry one\\'s duty. Also, the students may feel unsafe around the teacher. Lastly, the parents of that student (and other students) will feel uneasy sending their children to school if that teacher is on duty.\\nIn terms of the Standards and Practices for the teaching profession, this teacher does not promote the commitment to students and student learning as well as professional practice as the teacher did not pay attention to the students. A teacher when on duty must be aware at all times with what the student is doing. By observing the students playing foot hockey on asphalt, the teacher used professional judgment that this activity was safe. However, the end result proves otherwise. This injury could have been prevented if the teacher had spoken to them about being safe. Thus the teacher did not show commitment to students and to one\\'s own professional practice.,\\n8,1044,1,This is only a message to the people whom I will be facilitating tomorrow (Zack, Alex, Olivia, Carly, Wassim, Lorne, Tanya, Alexia, and Tori).  \\n  Would it be possible to read the sections that I have assigned below for tomorrow\\'s class?

Similarly, why would they discourage teachers from \"friending\" a student on Facebook or express concerns about a teacher privately \"tweeting\" a student on Twitter?\\n  The Ontario College of Teachers indicates that although teachers have private lives, the teaching profession is one of public knowledge. Using social media and emails are public tools that although provide various benefits, there is potential harm for both the teacher and the student. Joe Jamison believes that it is important that teachers act in a professional manner and students need to see teachers as professionals and not as friends. He thus argues that email has the potential to close the gap between the teacher/student professional relationship (and thus the private and professional life of the teacher). Jamison states teachers that email their students are more likely to be treated differently, and in some cases in an unprofessional manner. Through the constant interaction of emailing between teacher and student, the lines of professionalism can be crossed (students addressing teachers by their first name) and eventually the teacher will lose the students respect. This not only applies to emails but to other social media websites as well (Facebook, Twitter). To \"friend\" a student on Facebook or send a private tweet bridges the gap between student and teacher and professionalism gets blurred. In no way do teachers want students to lose respect of them, and as Jameson states \"students do not respect teachers that are their friend, but rather their teacher\". Once the teacher/student professional relationship has been crossed, there is a greater chance that the teacher perform an act that is of professional misconduct.\\n            For example, one act that the Ontario College of Teachers considers to be deemed professional misconduct is \"releasing or disclosing information about a student to a person other than the student or, if the student is a minor, the student’s parent or guardian\". Social media has the potential for students information to get leaked out or other potential dangerous information. The harm that could be done to students is amplified since using social media to communicate information becomes public knowledge even if the information is tended to be private. Information that get posted on these social media sources will be their forever and the harmful effects that it could have on students is limitless.\\n            These are the reasons that Jamison feels that teachers not communicate through email and potentially other social media sources.,\\n8,1046,1,1. A Legal Lens: What are the facts in this case and what is the main legal issue in this matter?\\n                 According the Criminal Code section 319, it states that it is a criminal act to publically promote the hatred of a specific group of people to students and such an act could result in imprisonment. Furthermore, the Provincial Code of Conduct states that teachers must not \"engage in hate propaganda and other forms of behaviour motivated by hate or bias\". In this case, James Keegstra was promoting the hatred of Jewish people to his students. Keegstra argued that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects his rights. Section 1 and 2 of the Charter does state that he has the right to free speech, and has the right to express his thoughts, beliefs, and opinions. Furthermore, the charter does state that these rights will be protected as long as it is deemed \"reasonable in a democratic society\". However, section 27 of the charter states that \"This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians\". Therefore, while Keegstra does have freedom of speech, he does not promote the Jewish culture in a positive light.\\n    2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: Describe the \"tension\" between the nature and limitations upon on individual\\'s Charter rights (i.e., the teacher\\'s academic freedom to certain expression of views) and the impact that these expressed views may have on students and society.\\n                           Based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, James Keegstra felt that he had the right to promote hate propaganda to his students and thus make his views public knowledge. According to the Ontario Human Rights Code \"Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, family status or handicap\" Since classrooms are diverse in nature (students have a wide array of cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds) there were students in Keegstra\\'s classroom could have been of Jewish descent and would thus be discriminated against. Furthermore, Keegstra does promote discrimination as (according to the Canadian human rights act) \"it is a discriminatory practice to publish or display before the public or to cause to be published or displayed before the public any notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation\" Keegstra actively and publically promotes that Jewish people should be treated differently and his students must accept his views. By forcing his students to accept his views, he is in itself denying students right to free speech and to openly object to his claims.\\n            On society as a whole, there could be even further division based on his opinion. Society itself may feel that Keegstra has the right to his opinions even if people believe that he is wrong with his beliefs. Others on the other hand may feel that students are impressionable and he is infecting the youth with hate propaganda and racism and thus should not be allowed to teach. Although society would generally view Keegstras opinions as wrong, society itself would have mixed opinions over whether or not Keegstra should be fired for expressing his opinions. Freedom of speech and expression are important in this country but the society would struggle with where to draw the line with academic freedom and hate propaganda.\\n    3.A Professional Ethics Lens: What professional ethics issues reside at the heart of this case?\\n                 The main ethical issues of \"care\" and \"respect\" are at the heart of this case. To care means that teachers must show compassion, acceptance, interest and insight for developing students\\'. Furthermore, teachers are committed to students\\' well-being and learning through positive influence, professional judgment and empathy in practice. Not only did Keegstra not show any of these traits, but hurt students using hate propaganda. To promote the hatred of a specific race or ethnicity is not compassionate and it illustrates that this teacher is not accepting of other people. Furthermore, hate propaganda is a negative influence of students and would affect their well being. Keegstra also does not show respect as he does not encourage spiritual and cultural values, social justice, confidentiality, freedom, democracy and the environment. He opposes them. Furthermore Keegstra has demonstrated that he not dedicated to student learning, does not demonstrate appropriate professional knowledge/practice, or leadership. To engage in professional practice in particular is to be reflecting in one\\'s own teaching. Even with possible backlash and being told that his views are wrong, he still engaged in his own hate propaganda and will not be told that his views are incorrect. His teaching is not of proper ethical standard and he should thus be barred from teaching.,\\n8,1047,2,1.  A Legal Lens:\\na) It is clear that cyber-bullying has occurred in this case. According to provincial laws and regulations, what is Ms. Marks obliged to do after overhearing Kayla’s and Ally’s conversation and being shown the contents Jay’s Facebook site\\n              Ms. Marks is obliged to go directly to the principal regarding this matter. The education act section 300.2 states that \"an employee of a board who becomes aware that a pupil of a school of the board may have engaged in an activity described in subsection 306 (1) or 310 (1) \"shall report to the principal of the school about the matter\".  Subsection 306 of the education act lists bullying as grounds for suspension, and cyberbullying is an act of bullying. According to Bill 13, bullying is defined by as behavior designed to cause an individual bodily or mental harm or create a negative setting. In this case, Sally was being bullied as she no longer felt safe to attend school. Since Ms. Marks is now aware that bullying has occurred, she must report to the principal immediately or by the end of the school day. After the verbal report, a written report must be written if it is safe to do so.\\n    b) According to provincial laws and regulations, what steps should be taken by the school regarding Kayla’s, Ally’s and Jay’s actions?\\n                      Since bullying falls under section 306 of the education act, both the education act and bill 212 state that the principal should consider to suspend these students. The principal must therefore look at mitigating factors. These factors are:\\n  \"a) the pupil does not have the ability to control his or her behaviour\\nb) the pupil does not have the ability to understand the foreseeable consequences of his or her behaviour\\nc) the pupil\\'s continuing presence in the school does not create an unacceptable risk to the safety of any person\".\\n            After looking at the mitigating factors, the principal should then decide whether or not to suspend the students.\\n    c) What steps should be taken by the school with reference to Sandy, the victim in this scenario?\\n               Based on policy 144 - Bullying and Prevention and intervention, once the school is aware that the student Sandy is the subject of bullying, the teacher and principal need to inform her parents/guardians (unless she is 18 or 16-17 and is not under parental control). Furthermore, the school (and school boards) should implement intervention and support strategies to help Sandy. Teachers also need to be properly trained to help students (like Sandy) cope with bullying.\\n    d) What is the teacher’s role concerning students’ use of technology outside of the school?\\n              According to the York Region Appropriate Use of Technology document, teachers are responsible for the overall management of student use of computing and information technology facilities and resources within their assigned teaching areas or when acting in a supervisory role; and instructing and modeling for students the appropriate use of technology. This means that teachers are to set the appropriate example for what is and is not appropriate use of technology. Since teachers are thus responsible to make sure that students are using technology safely they must enforce safety rules like: revealing your personal identity, giving out your password, using inappropriate websites (Facebook, Twitter), never sending pictures of oneself to other people.\\n  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens:\\n\\na) Changes to the Education Act encourage the promotion of a positive school climate including activities that promote gender equity. How would a positive proactive response to this incident promote gender equity?\\n    Since the case study clearly indicates that bullying has occurred, an incident like this must be reported to the principal as stated in section 306 of the education act. Although, the principal has the right and authority under the education act to suspend these students, other actions can be taken to help promote gender equality. Section 303.1 states that “every board shall support pupils who want to establish and lead activities and organizations that promote a safe and inclusive learning environment, the acceptance of and respect for others and the creation of a positive school climate, including, (a) activities or organizations that promote gender equity”. Therefore, the principal and teachers have Kayla, Sandy, Ally and Jay start an organization that raises awareness of bullying and cyberbullying. Each student could share their experiences about how the incident affected them. Having Jay and the female students talk about their experiences could also raise gender equity issues, such as how female/male students are treated. Also, these students could also talk about not just the incident but of bullying in general.\\n    3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\\n  a) With all these changes to safe schools legislation what can teachers expect in the way of professional development support when it comes to the issue of bully?\\n        According to the Education act section 170 (7.1), it is expected that these professional development programs “establish and provide annual professional development programs to educate teachers and other staff of the board about bullying prevention and strategies for promoting positive school climates”. These bullying prevention programs should encourage teachers to follow the ethical standards of the teaching profession so teachers can better be able to deal with students who are victims of bullying. The programs should help teachers become more caring about the emotional well-being of students along with teaching teachers how to promote acceptance and compassion to those who are being bullied. Also, these programs should also provide support to teachers to help talk to parents of children that are both being bullied and are the bully.\\n    b) As a member of the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, what are the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards? How would these standards support preventative measures?\\n              In order to prevent cases of bullying, students need to be able to speak to the teacher about these issues. The mistake in this case study was that Sandy did not talk to her teacher. This mistake led to this hijacking scenario to get out of control, to the point where Sandy is no longer safe in school. In order for Sandy to feel secure, the teacher needed to show the ethical standards of care, trust, respect, and integrity. If a student can confide in a teacher and feel comfortable talking about incidents of bullying, then a teacher can do whatever means necessary to prevent it from going further. A student needs to feel that a teacher is accepting of the student, regardless of any mistakes on made. This also demonstrates that the student respects the teacher as well. As a teacher, however, needs to show integrity and be honest with the student about what he/she will do with this knowledge.,\\n8,1049,1,1. A Legal Lens:\\na) What is an appropriate disciplinary course of action for the male student who made the slur?\\n                 A suspension or expulsion would be appropriate for this male student. Under section 310 of the education act, \"A principal shall suspend a pupil if he or she believes that the pupil has engaged in.....any activity listed in subsection 306 (1) that is motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or any other similar factor\". This student was not only bullying Tricia (which is subsection 306 of the education act), but, the remark was motivated from Tricia\\'s outward appearance and addressed her sexual orientation.\\n  b) Should Tricia, the girl who instigated the shoving match in response to the slur, be disciplined differently than the student who made the slur? What mitigating factors might the principal consider?\\n              Tricia should be treated differently and not be suspended. According to Regulation 472 a mitigating factor that the principal should consider is \"whether the activity for which the pupil may be or is being suspended or expelled was related to any harassment of the pupil because of his or her race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation or to any other harassment\". In this instance, Tricia was the subject to discrimination due to her gender and sexual orientation.\\n  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: In the past few years changes to the Education Act, as well as educational policies and regulations, have been designed to counter some of the flaws in previously existing \"zero-tolerance\" styled laws. Researchers have found that zero-tolerance educational laws have had disproportionate and negative effects on groups such as, adolescent males, different language groups, racial minorities, those designated for special education, or those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.**\\n  a) As a beginning teacher how you would address the incident with the victim? With the rest of the team? With the student who made the slur?\\n              In terms of the student, I would make the student more proactive in the cause for gender equity and rights. 303.1 of the education act states that \"every board shall support pupils who want to establish and lead activities and organizations that promote a safe and inclusive learning environment, the acceptance of and respect for others and the creation of a positive school climate\". In this case, I would want Tricia to create an organization that promotes the awareness of gender equity and people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, including organizations with the name gay-straight alliance or another name. With the rest of the team, I think it\\'s important to ensure the team that Tricia should be treated equitably and with the same amount of respect that you would have given to her previously. The team should be aware that Tricia took offense to the student that made the slur. It\\'s important to make sure the team supports Tricia and they should stand by her both as a teammate and as her friend. To the student that made the slur I would explain to the student that it was completely unacceptable for him to use that slur. It was wrong to use any racist or homosexual remarks, that what the student did ruined the event and that he that there will be consequences for his slur and his actions. Even though he did not start the fight it with his words that enticed it and it led to someone being hurt. This student will be sent to the principal\\'s office and the student should be told that he could be suspended or even expelled for his actions. However the student should also be told that he could be given a second chance if he\\'s willing to learn why what he said was incredibly offensive (i.e. attend gay awareness seminars).\\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\\nIn light of the incident, how might a gay/straight alliance club promote a deeper understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation\\n                 I think that a gay/straight alliance club could promote student growth and well-being, acceptance among all students, and compassion from both the student body and the school community. A club that addresses gender identity and sexual orientation issues would draw all different members of the student body. First, students that are gay would be open to join as it provides a safe environment for these students to openly talk about homosexual issues. Also, allowing straight students to join provides an opportunity for learning about homosexual issues. By making this alliance a safe and secure place allows for thoughts, feelings, and experiences to be talked about and explored. School communities would want a club like this because it also raises awareness of about gay/straight issues. A gay/straight club would make students more educated about these issues and could help prevent incidents (like the slur against Tricia) from ever happening.,\\n8,1050,2,As a teacher, this to me indicates that Mr. Jones is sexually abusing one of his students because sexual abuse is defined as inappropriate touching of a student. The teacher openly lied to me about the performance, the teacher was alone with a student, the room was in darkness, and his arm is around the shoulder of his grade 3 student (the latter of which is sexual abuse). This type of action is grounds for professional misconduct and thus it is my duty based on the teacher education act, and the child services act to report Mr Jones to my principal and any other legal authority. Even if Mr. Jones were to claim that he is not sexually abusing his students, I would still have to report him because of my suspicion, otherwise I would be in violation of professional misconduct.,\\n8,1051,1,As a teacher it is important that I would never be alone with a student at all times and write what a student says to me. In Mr. Safah\\'s example, the student made a threat to the teacher. In order to clear his name, he had written down what was said to him and had other students sign the statement. This was used as evidence that no sexual abuse/assault took place. Therefore, I would write anything down that was said to me by my students. Furthermore, what I could do to protect myself is make sure that doors are open at all times so I can be visible as possible. Lastly, I would make sure that I would not do anything to further cross the line between teacher and student relationship (not give out personal information, not use email as contact).,\\n8,1052,1,As a teacher, I must follow the child and services act. According to section 72, “if a person, including a person who performs professional or official duties with respect to children, has reasonable grounds to suspect one of the following, the person shall forthwith report the suspicion and the information on which it is based to a society”. One of “the following” that this section discusses is that the person (or child) “has suffered physical harm inflicted by someone in charge of one’s care”. In this case, the teacher suspects that Michael’s father has struck his son. Furthermore, section 79 of this act states that child abuse is considered an offensive as it defines physical harm as one of its characteristics. Therefore, the teacher must report this to the principal.,\\n8,1053,1,If you haven\\'t seen this....\\n  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSf1Xudapyk\\n   ,\\n8,1054,2,Here is the handout from our presentation today!,\\n8,1055,1,   Thank you so much, Susan - this insight into your process is much appreciated!,\\n8,1056,1,I really like Jump Math.\\nI first got introduced to it in my second placement and I thought it was great. I especially liked how everything was extremely scaffolded.  I am pretty sure that I read JUMP math is created similar to DI (direct instruction) programs in the sense that students only will learn 5-10% more each lesson. For anxious, struggling students, this is good because there is a lot of room for review, and the next lessons are not overwhelming. \\nAlso, as a teacher it was easy to see where the student was struggling. If they are struggling with \\'fractions\\' you could go back to see which particular part of fractions they are struggling with because it was so broken down. Sometimes in student centred or inquiry it is hard to see which part of the concept was confusing for the student. \\n\\nAlso, I liked JUMP math because I don\\'t think it is just \\'skills and drills.\\' They refered to it as \"guided discovery.\" The students, and myself, were still learning WHY things were the way they were. I never learned this in school, and jump math made it very clear. The teacher still had to ask questions to the student to help them figure out reasons why the math was working. \\n\\nIn addition, I liked the scripted lessons in JUMP. I think this is good for consistency of language. I find, and I\\'m sure some students find, math language can be confusing. By using a scripted lesson (similar to DI approach), it ensures certain terms are not thrown around or that the teacher jumps back n forth between terms that might throw the student off. I think the consistency is good. \\n\\nOn the other hand, though, I can see why some do not like JUMP math. There are not a lot of communication questions, and I don\\'t think there are too many aplication concepts. It\\'s great for understanding the knowledge section but it doesn\\'t have a good representation for the entire achievement chart. \\n\\nI think, however, that teachers can teach the concepts through JUMPif they wish, but add their own application questions to the program while still following the program - (maybe?)\\n\\nPS. the program has a lot of really good 3 part math lesson ideas that are hands on. They are built in to the program too. ,\\n8,1057,6,hehe, I see JUMP Math as a hybrid of what you mentioned: \"guided skills and drills\"\\n  Something I mentioned to Joe, Shira, Emilie, Steph, and Maria during my facilitation in Shelley\\'s class yesterday: in the book The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, Christopher\\'s rigorous \"A explains B which explains C which is why D is true when E is also true\" mode of reasoning may be deviant from the \"norm\", but for a long time I kind of assumed that that kind of constructivist reasoning we see in Chris was the default for math classes everywhere. TBH I can\\'t really imagine math concepts NOT being scaffolded that way...\\n  re: I think, however, that teachers can teach the concepts through JUMPif they wish, but add their own application questions to the program while still following the program - (maybe?)\\n  That\\'s pretty much how I\\'ve been teaching math for the past several years (not with JUMP, but with a lot of scaffolding, which I\\'d argue is just as important for strong math students as math-anxious as it encourages students to reason their way through their decision-making, which in turn promotes deep understanding through practice). I seldom have time to address questions of social justice in the classroom (whatever that looks like), but as Nikki mentioned in class today, I believe the solid math grounding itself will enable students to be more critical of the world around them. If taught right (?), the students should be able to apply their knowledge to new/complex situations too. That\\'s pretty much my philosophy to math instruction. I (feel that I have to) have faith that if they are to learn about social issues in science, they will do so mostly in science class. If they learn about social issues in history, they will do so mostly in history class. Realistically, I don\\'t see non-math teachers integrating math concepts seriously/deeply into their classes, so I consider my primary role to be in providing students with a mathematical skill set. Conversely, I wouldn\\'t want my math class to turn into the \"everything-but-math class\".\\n  That isn\\'t to say I don\\'t believe in cross-curricular integration; just that I\\'m reluctant to teach in way that math becomes demoted to a supporting role. e.g. are we using math as a piece of evidence to explain the seriousness of racial profiling in law enforcement? Or are we using racial profiling as an example to teach how ratios/percentages can be meaningful in real world contexts? I think it\\'s worth thinking about the distinction between the two as a starting point to inform our approach to cross-curricular integration (and social justice, environmental stewardship, technology, etc.) If it\\'s the former, I\\'d much rather collaborate with a social studies teacher and tell him/her that I\\'m teaching the students about ratios in my math class, and request that ratios be mentioned in passing in social studies class. Maybe it\\'s the purist in me, but sometimes I feel that too much integration can be parasitic rather than symbiotic (ecology terms w00t).\\n  -Cak,\\n8,1058,1,    -Cak,\\n8,1059,2,APPitic (http://appitic.com/) is another one with a nice categorization system!\\n    -Cak,\\n8,1060,1,Totally feeling this!\\n  -Cak,\\n8,1061,1,  -Cak,\\n8,1062,1,Hey Friends,\\n  Here is a digital copy of the handout of today\\'s resources. \\n  Lorne,\\n8,1063,1,Electronic communication is extraordinarily delicate because it both lacks the additional ability to distinguish “tone” as well as has the ability to be easily captured as a permanent record.  Tweets, social media messages, email, texts, etc, all fall under that chapeau.  Given the extraordinary high ability to be misunderstood or misconstrued, combined with the ability to be saved for future reference, it is extremely unwise for educators in a position of authority to communicate with their students in anything other than an extremely public fashion.  Additionally, adults as well as children increasingly have a digital identity as individuals.  For adults, that identity can be comprehensive and quite personal, having begun when younger and comprising numerous forums such as hobbies, professional interests, personal relationships, etc.  Inviting a student to participate with that online, comprehensive identity is a boundary violation which would be much clearer if done in person – ie, invited into the home or out on a weekend – but is somehow not always understood as the boundary crossing that it is.  “Friending” a student implies exactly that – inviting a student into your life as a peer.  For a teacher, that is clear misconduct and inappropriate.,\\n8,1064,1,  1.\\nA Legal Lens: What are the facts in this case and what is the main legal issue in this matter?\\n  Keegstra did not dispute that he had made the statements he made; therefore, the facts of the case about what was said and to whom were not in convention.  Essentially, the main legal issue did not centre around “who did what to whom” but rather, whether those facts constituted a violation of section 319 of the criminal code, which indicates everyone who incites hatred against any identifiable group through statements in public place, where such is likely to lead to a breach of the peace, is guilty of an offense.  In the end, 3 of the 7 judges felt that Keegstra was not guilty, despite his obvious role of authority in a public space.  That is as important to remember as the 4 who ruled him guilty. \\n    2.\\nAn Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: Describe the \"tension\" between the nature and limitations upon on individual\\'s Charter rights (i.e., the teacher\\'s academic freedom to certain expression of views) and the impact that these expressed views may have on students and society.\\n  He claimed that he was exercising “12…..(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression.” However, in addition to providing certain rights to individuals, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms also prevents the denial of those rights to others brought about through the express of someone else’s rights: “26. The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in Canada.”  In exercising “12” he was in contravention of “26” as he was promoting a viewpoint in contravention of “27” which indicates “[t]his Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians.”\\nIn short: Your right to swing your fist ends at my nose.\\n    3.\\nA Professional Ethics Lens: What professional ethics issues reside at the heart of this case?\\n      ‘Care’, ‘respect’, ‘trust’, ‘integrity.’  Keegstra violated all of these central tenants of the Ethical Standards of the OCT.   The ripples of his impact cannot be isolated to those Jewish individuals present in his class; he actively used his role as a teacher to spread his views so that others would come to hold them and likely to act on them. ,\\n8,1065,1,    A Legal Lens: What action would you take in response to the situation described in case study one?\\nThe situation is suspicious enough – particularly given the outright lying about the reason for having the students behind – that there is enough justification to be suspicious of inappropriate conduct.  According to the Child and Family Services Act: “Anyone who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is or may be in need of protection must promptly report the suspicion and the information upon which it is based to a CAS.” I would report the situation directly to Children’s Aid Society and trust that that they have their own process.  To support any further investigation, I would write out the detailed report with as much information as possible as soon as possible (exact location, those present – Mr Jones, the student, myself – date, time of day, etc).  In addition to reporting to CAS, I would let my principal know immediately, and clarify the process for reporting based on the specific board policies in place (presumably consistent with the overarching legal framework).  Given the specific topic, I would not inform Mr.Jones of my concerns at that point nor my intention to report him to a superior.  ,\\n8,1066,1,  An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: As a teacher, what steps could you take to protect yourself from false accusations as described in case study two?\\n  Ensuring that my interactions with students occur with witnesses; that there are clear boundaries between work and personal life and that those boundaries are known (and therefore can be corroborated) by various students and staff; that the door is kept open or viewable (ie, class views into the class); that I take and save detailed notes whenever I become suspicious of any strange behaviour on the part of a student.,\\n8,1067,1,    A Professional Ethics Lens: What action would you take in response to case study three?\\n  Beyond the question of ethics, there is a question of legal obligation to report: “Anyone who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is or may be in need of protection must promptly report the suspicion and the information upon which it is based to a CAS.”  However, given the seriousness of the consequences a report warrants some minimal questioning to ensure that the grounds are in fact ‘reasonable’ and that other explanations were at least investigated.  Where did the scuffle take place? What was it about?  What object was responsible for the cut?  Perhaps catching the brother and posing similar questions.  If their stories completely corroborate, there is minimal cause for suspicion.  If they do not, then a report to CAS is obligatory.  Additionally, the OCT includes ‘care’ in its professional standards.  ‘Care’ would indicate care that the student is being harmed physically, whether or not that is coming from an adult.  If he and his brother are fighting, that also warrants attention and possibly intervention through counselling or other methods, or possibly pulling in the parents as they may be unaware.,\\n8,1068,1,  After reading the \"Context\" and \"Law and Regulations\" sections of Module 1 please \"reply\" with your answers to these frequently asked questions around the Duties and Responsibilities of Teachers.\\n  1. If a teacher is assigned a specific grade that he/she does not want to teach, can the teacher refuse the teaching assignment?\\n  Of course a teacher CAN refuse; however, it’s doubtful that teacher will be teaching anything after that refusal.\\n  2. If a teacher is a witness to a serious incident on school property what is his/her responsibility regarding the investigation of the incident?\\n  According to Education Act Section 264(1) e: “It is the duty of the teacher and temporary teacher (e) to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline in the teacher’s classroom and while on duty in the school and on the school ground.”  Further, Duties of Teachers – 20 – b - it indicates teachers are to “carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require.”\\n    3. If I have a student in my class who has been identified as anaphylactic with an allergy to peanuts, what is my responsibility?\\n  There are a series of issues under Ontario legislation “Sabrina’s Law” (2005). These include both preventative and reactive responsibilities for students.  For instance, schools are now nut-free.  Additionally, teachers have the ability to administer epi-pens for students with allergies.  However, first aid treatments and laws change; therefore, it is the responsibility of the teacher to be familiar with the current laws and recommended procedures for those with allergies.  There are several frequently asked questions available online: http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/healthyschools/bill3qanda.html  Additionally, the situation in a rural school far from hospitals is significantly different than urban centres; responsibilities reflect the reality of access to care and teachers should be aware of their own reality.\\n  4. I observe two students talking on the playground and watch as a slim shiny object is passed from one student to the other. The receiving student bends down and places the item in his sock. What should my actions be?\\n  As the teacher is the authority under the direction of the principal, the most logical step would be to bring them to the principal to investigate more thoroughly.  The desire to conceal the object in the sock is sufficiently covert that further questioning is warranted, particularly as it may be a weapon and endanger other students.\\n    5. Can a teacher reproduce a whole literary work and distribute it to the students in his/her class?\\n  No.  Teachers in Canada are subject to Canadian copyright laws which prohibit the distribution of complete works. \\n       ,\\n8,1069,1,    1.If a student in my class appears to be unable to benefit from the instruction in the class because they are lethargic and often fall asleep in class what should I do?\\n  Professional ethics indicate that “care” is part of the equation.  The mental health of students is extremely important, as are possible signs of abuse (ie, depression; substance use leading to lethargy; exploitation through child labour).  However, depending on the age/charactheristics of the child it may simply be too many extracurricular and a joy of reading keeping him/her awake into the night.  Questioning to get a sense of which of the many possibilities is at work is a first step beyond making any rash judgement calls.\\n    2. What are my protections if a student makes a false accusation of sexual misconduct on my part?\\n  There is a difference between sexual misconduct and criminal charges.  The former is one of professional misconduct; as a member of the Federation, I would have recourse to their supports.   If it were the latter, legal supports would be in order and it would depend on various board policies. \\n    3. I receive a call from a parent of one of my students stating that they would like a report on their child\\'s academic progress. I am aware that there has been a recent change in marital status of the parents and am unsure of whether I should provide this information.\\n  There is a delicate balance between respecting the law and actively investigating a custody situation.  I would confirm that the office has not been officially informed of a change in custody with corresponding directions on how to disclose information; however, if there has been no official directive, it is not the prerogative of a teacher to withhold information on a child from a parent.   \\n    4. One of your students approaches you and asks if they can speak to you in confidence about a personal matter. In the course of the discussion, it is revealed to you that a criminal act may have been committed. What should you do?\\n  Legal requirements around reporting if someone is a danger to themselves or others takes precedence over any supposed confidentiality assumed by a student.  If harm was not a possibility, I would consult my administrator regarding my obligations in the specific situation and act from there.,\\n8,1070,1,Article discussing Chris Spence and the tendency to hold up racialized people as representatives of their entire ethnic group, while decrying white people\\'s actions as individual missteps:\\n    Chris Spence’s Debt to the Black Community\\nNo one can expect Spence alone to own the unfulfilled promise of the socially-constructed group of people we call black.\\nhttp://torontoist.com/2013/01/does-chris-spence-owe-black-people-a-separate-apology/,\\n8,1071,3,1.

The app, touching upon Geometry and Spatial Reasoning skills, presents players with images of both regular and irregular shapes on graph paper. There are five episodes in Slice It! and there are a multiple stages within each episode.\\n  Each stage presents a distinct shape or multiple shapes, and as the user advances, the stages become more challenging than the previous.  The user is responsible for cutting the shape into equal parts all the while meeting specific conditions such as how many slices to make, and how many equal pieces need to be created from the slices.  Once the image is sliced, the user is able to watch the whole shape be sliced apart into the individual parts, and receives feedback on the accuracy of the sliced pieces.\\n  Depending on the accuracy, the user may receive one to five star rewards. The accuracy of the slicing to create near to equal parts as well the accumulation of stars allows the user to access slicing hints if necessary in more challenging stages. The slicing results reveal whether the user has passed or failed the stage. In the case of failing the stage, the user may retry slicing the shape and apply the generated results to improve their next try. The user may also choose to advance to the next stage without retrying the failed stage, however, they will not be awarded stars for this.\\n  We believe that this app can support student learning by providing them with visual representations of what can sometimes be abstract concepts such as; symmetry, fractions, percentages, ratios, etc. Through the app users can visually see the effects of manipulating a whole object or shape to create smaller pieces of a whole. We see relevancy of this app and the cross curricular connections it can have in Mathematics, Language and Visual Arts. ,\\n8,1086,1,Case Study 1\\n  1. A Legal Lens:  The Education Act has that it’s the duty of a teacher to maintain order and discipline in the classroom and school grounds, while one duty. This includes providing supervision each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils. In the absence of mitigating factors, the teacher is legally culpable, in this case, for the injuries that resulted as a result of their not being on supervisory duty.\\n2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: If the incident was initiated by a racist act or comment, the board must ensure that there are educational practices that are inclusive in place to educate students around issues of race. If there are not appropriate mechanisms in place to address these concerns, the board is accountable.  \\n3. A Professional Ethics Lens: Though the teacher may have been fulfilling their obligations in terms of care, trust, respect and integrity by attending to an issue outside of their prescribed duty, they would be hardpressed to justify their absence from the cafeteria, as in that case they were neglecting their obligation to these ethical dimensions within the context of their supervisory role. The safety of the students were compromised in this case, and the teacher’s professional and ethical duties were not adhered to.Number 11 of OCT’s Misconduct Regulation states that “failing to supervise adequately a person who is under the professional supervision of the member” is an act of professional misconduct.,\\n8,1087,1,Case Study 2\\nA Legal Lens: In the case that a teacher or principal has reasonable grounds to suspect students are selling drugs, the issue of what constitutes ‘reasonable grounds’ is particularly germane. Students are protected from being seized and searched unreasonably, but teachers and principals also have the duty to enforce laws around drugs, weapons, etc. according to the Ontario Ministry of Education Provincial Code of Conduct and School Board Codes of Conduct. If drugs were found to be in the possession of the students, suspension would be in order.\\n  2. A Professional Ethics Lens:  It is our duty to show care and respect to students at all time. We need to use our professional judgment in making difficult decisions as in, for example, of a case we are suspicious that students might be selling drugs. I think the suspicion needs to be examined, because it would disrespectful and harmful for students to wrongfully suspect students of such activity. If it is the case that students are in fact engaging in the use and selling of drugs, teachers need to address the issue with more than just punishment.,\\n8,1088,1,Case Study 3\\nA Legal Lens:  According to the Ed Act, the teacher is obligated to “give assiduous attention to the health and comfort” of the students under their supervision. In this case, it is necessary that the teacher attends to the injured student. The teacher should stay in the yard, and with that student, where he or she can both attend to the injury and be present for their supervisory duties. Sending a student inside would presumably bring support so that another adult could supervise the yard while the teacher attended to the injured child.\\n2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: Teachers must adhere to Reg 298 because children need to be taught, by adults, how to interact and handle issues of equity and diversity. It is our job, as a teacher, to make this teaching a part of our supervisory duties. If children are left to their own devices and there are problems, they cannot be held accountable, but adults can be held accountable for the failure to provide sufficient supervision and intervention when necessary.\\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens: As a member of the College of Teachers  it is my duty to provide care for students. In this case, where the physical well-being of a student has been compromised, I must do everything I can to see to it that they get sufficient medical attention. Head injuries can be extremely serious, and the signs of severe head injury are not always apparent to someone without medical training. Care, in this case, requires me to follow-up with the student’s outcomes, to ensure they have been adequately attended to.\\n ,\\n8,1089,1,Question 1\\nMr. Jamieson uses email correspondence as an example of how ‘private spaces’ of communication can lend to the blurring of boundaries between students and teachers. He recommends that teachers not communicate with their students by email because 1) communication can be more easily understood 2) communication often becomes ‘inappropriately familiar and 3) this familiarity sends the message to students that the teacher-student relationship can change. Jamieson also makes the point that it’s easy for students to attain a record of correspondence which may latter be interpreted as inappropriate, especially when out of context. Communicating with students on Facebook and Twitter is similarly risky for the same reasons; and especially because many students associate social media with a way to communicate with their peers, room for boundary-confusion is even more present.,\\n8,1090,1,Question 2\\n      A legal lens: A teacher, promoting hatred of and discrimination against Jews in his classroom, was in violation of the criminal code (section 319) which states:\\nEvery one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace is guilty of\\n(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or\\n(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\\n  2)  An Equity, Diversity and Social Justice Lens: The accused teacher brought his case before the Supreme Court by challenging these charges in light of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the freedoms of thought, belief, opinion and expression:\\n12. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:\\n(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;\\n  His case, in regards to the charter, is complicated further by the fact that the CoRaF also prevents the denial of the existence of any other rights or freedoms to others, and preserves the ‘enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians:\\n  26. The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in Canada.\\n·Marginal note:Multicultural heritage\\n27. This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians.\\n  The tension arises between freedom of expression vs. the freedom of all from hate and discrimination. While a teacher has the right, according to the Charter, to express herself freely, she cannot do so if that expression infringes on the freedoms of her students and others.\\n  3)Professional Ethical issues: The actions of the teacher in this case study contradict the spirit of care and respect that is central to the Ethical Standards statement of the OCT. According to this statement, teachers must extend compassion, acceptance, empathy and respect for spiritual and cultural values to all of their students. Whether or not an identifiable group is represented within a class, a teacher has the professional obligation to treat all of these groups with care and respect, thereby teaching their students to do the same.\\n ,\\n8,1091,1,Case study 1\\nA Legal Lens a-d:  Ms. Marks is required to report what she overheard to the school principal, according to Policy and Programming memorandum 145. The incident should be seen to have a negative impact on school climate, and therefore must be reported and addressed. At that point, it would be up to the principal to decide whether or not to give a suspension to the students involved in the bullying, or whether to take other action.  The principal would also be responsible for notifying the parents of the victim, unless he or she believes that doing so would put the student at further risk. In the case that the parents were not notified, the principal must make sure accommodations are made for the student’s care.\\nTeachers do have a role in being aware of and managing, as far as is reasonably possible, the cyber-goings on between students, insofar as these relationships may negatively affect students and the school climate. “According to the Education Act 306.  (1),   ‘a principal shall consider whether to suspend a pupil if he or she believes that the pupil has engaged in any of the following activities while ….in … circumstances where engaging in the activity will have an impact on the school climate: .....6. Bullying.’’,\\n8,1092,1,Case Study 2\\n1 Case Study 2\\n  After reading the \"Context\" and \"Law and Regulations\" sections of Module 3 please \"reply\" to this note with answers to the following questions for Case Study #2.\\n  1. A Legal Lens a-b: \\nThe student may be suspended, by the principal, for up to 20 school days. I think that, in this case, suspension may or may not be warranted, depending on other circumstantial or mitigating factors. A lot of time would need to be spent understanding the relationship between the two students, as well as history of behaviours of both students. Though this may be an unlikely situation, it could be that the students has Tourettes Syndrome, and exhibits coprolalia as a symptom. It could be that the student, as well as Tricia, has shown difficulty in the past understanding the consequences of their actions. In some cases, suspension may not be the most effective way of ensuring this kind of behaviour isn’t repeated, but in some cases it may.\\n    2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: I would start by asking the victim how they felt about the situation and why they reacted the way they did. I would explain that what the other student did was unacceptable, and try to help her understand why sometimes people say things with the intention to hurt others, and explain what kind of consequences have ensued for the boy who shouted the slur. There definitely needs to be a discussion around homophobia and how the student can deal with instances like this in the future without getting physical. This is a job that needs to be done with the team, as well as the girl. The student who made the slur needs all this as well, but also needs to be helped to see why his comment was hurtful, and that comments like that cannot be made under any circumstances. There have to be consequences that would be determined with mitigating factors being taken into account. As a beginning teacher, I would definitely consult the school administration as to how to proceed.\\n  3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\\n  I think that GSAs generally support understanding around issues of sexuality in schools, but I wouldn’t necessarily start one in reaction to this incident. I think that would be making a lot of presumptions. If one already existed, it would be helpful in terms of having a clear place to discuss the incident and devise a plan of action to bring more awareness to the school community in general around issues of sexuality.,\\n8,1093,1,Case Study 1\\n  A Legal Lens: What action would you take in response to the situation described in case study one?\\n  As the situation is described, there are clearly grounds to be suspicious of inappropriate conduct. Given that, I would as a teacher have the duty to report. The Child and Family Services Act states that “Anyone who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is or may be in need of protection must promptly report the suspicion and the information upon which it is based to a CAS.” Included in its definition of ‘a child who is or may be in need’ is ‘3. The child has been sexually molested or sexually exploited (suspected to have been), by the person having charge of the child or by another person where the person having charge of the child knows or should know of the possibility of sexual molestation or sexual exploitation and fails to protect the child.’ It’s important to note that, according to the Teaching Profession Act, any teacher who makes an adverse report about the suspicion of sexual abuse in regards to another teacher and a student does not need to furnish that teacher with the complaint, or any information about the complaint. According to the details of the case study, I would report the situation directly to Children’s Aid Society.\\n      Related References for Module 4, question 1:\\nFrom the TEACHING PROFESSION ACT\\nReporting sexual abuse\\n(2)  Despite any regulation made under subsection (1), a member who makes an adverse report about another member respecting suspected sexual abuse of a student by that other member need not provide him or her with a copy of the report or with any information about the report. 2002, c. 7, s. 7.\\nDefinition\\n(3)  In subsection (2),\\n“sexual abuse” of a student by a member means,\\n(a) sexual intercourse or other forms of physical sexual relations between the member and the student,\\n(b) touching, of a sexual nature, of the student by the member, or\\n(c) behaviour or remarks of a sexual nature by the member towards the student. 2002, c. 7, s. 7.\\nFROM THE OCT REGUATIONS\\n  3 Abusing a student sexually.\\n·  Contravening a law if the contravention has caused or may cause a student who is under the member’s professional supervision to be put at or to remain at risk.\\n·  An act or omission that, having regard to all the circumstances, would reasonably be regarded by members as disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional.\\n    FROM The CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT\\nChild abuse\\n(2)No person having charge of a child shall,\\n(a) inflict abuse on the child; or\\n(b) by failing to care and provide for or supervise and protect the child adequately,\\n(i) permit the child to suffer abuse, or\\n(ii) permit the child to suffer from a mental, emotional or developmental condition that, if not remedied, could seriously impair the child’s development.\\n  An Equity, Diversity and Social Justice Lens: M. Safar showed a lot of foresight in documenting the threat of the girl, and by having two other students witness it. It sounded as though he had very clear boundaries in place and was quite aware of the issues that arise out of teacher-student relationships. The lawyer confirms this, suggesting that teachers ‘trust their intuition’ and be careful not to let their suspicions slide. We don’t know what other measures he took in reaction to the girl’s comments; perhaps he really did reach out to her and to her parents, realizing that she was obviously not thinking clearly about her responsibilities. I think it’s important also, in addition to being very careful with documentation and boundary-setting, that we take preventative measures when we realize that something’s amiss.\\n  Professional/Ethical Issues: As teachers, it is our duty to report any suspicions that a child under our care may be in need of protection. It sounds that in the case of this student, grounds for suspicion of physical abuse are reasonable. It would by my obligation to CAS.\\n ,\\n8,1094,1,Hey Catherine,\\n  Here are my edits.

Surprisingly, I came out of the experience a little unimpressed.  Perhaps, I had been expecting too much.\\n            This is not to say that the school was unequipped.  They had a SMART board in every classroom, a computer lab, projectors, a portable laptop station, portable television sets, three desktop computers in my room, one of which was for a child with a SEA claim.  You can understand why students did not need to bring in their own portable devices to school. \\n            In my time there, the only devices I saw students using from home was a laptop computer one child brought to school as part of a SEA claim in order to help him with word processing, which he greatly benefitted from.  Students did not appear to have cell phones, mp3 players, or tablets, or at least they didn’t bring them to school.\\n            I began by trying to categorize the uses of the technologies into Type I and Type I.  It seemed like most of the technologies, although new and plentiful, were used to teach the same things in the same way they had traditionally been taught (Type I).  The SMART board, when it did work, was used as a glorified projector, to show educational clips, websites, and movies.  When it wasn’t used by teachers to display information, it was used like a whiteboard when student interaction with the SMART board took place.  Such would be expected from a portable television set, but not so much from an interactive board.\\n            When the students were taken to the computer lab, it was mostly to do research on different topics they had been discussing in class, which is another example of a Type I use, or for word processing, which may be considered Type II.  Even though the internet allows for us to access more information a lot faster, this use still cannot be categorized as Type II (“uses which constitute a new and better way of teaching (Maddux & Johnson, 2005))”.  This is not to say that Type I uses do not have their merits, but that having so many expensive forms of technology at one’s disposal should be justified by better use, which fully captures the capabilities of the technology.  Traditional uses can be achieved for a lot less money.\\n            I must say that I am also to blame for using the technology as Type I.  I was teaching most of the classes after all.  In an attempt to take my teaching to the next level, I used the SMART board to have students interact with a simulation based on how different simple machines worked, and why they helped to make work easier.  The students were allowed to compare various combinations and explain why some were better than others. \\n            Clearly, we still have a long way to go.  Just having the technology does not necessarily mean that it will be used to its fullest potential.  I saw this first hand.  In order for technology to add value to learning, it must be used in ways that allow the learner to interact with and control the outcomes.  Type II technologies attempt to do this, whereas Type I technologies, in a way, deny the existence of technology itself.\\n  References\\n1) Maddux, C.D., & Johnson, D.L. (2005).

The special education class consisted of 7 students between grades four and six. These students had severe learning needs. Throughout the four weeks, I witnessed technology being used by both the teacher and the students. Technology ranged from the Promethean Board, to individual iPads, and computers that were equipped with assistive technology.\\n            The Promethean Board was not often used for lessons since most lessons consisted of scripted Direct Instruction and were often one-on-one. The Promethean Board, however, was used for social skills lessons, mindfulness, and science (all of which did not follow the DI handbooks). In this classroom, I did not see the Promethean board being used as a tool that enhanced pedagogy. It was still being used at the first stage of the process of pedagogical development described by Higgens and Beauchamp (2007) . Higgen and Beauchamp indicate that the first stage supports didactic where the IAW is used to enhance traditional board focused didactic teaching (p. 217). Most of the time, the learning at the board was teacher directed and not interactive.\\n            Although the students were not interacting, it was beneficial for them as it increased engagement. Clemens et al. (2001) described some benefits for learning when an IWB was used with very young low-attaining pupils. All these reports outline the link between the capacity of IWB technology to enliven presentation, increase pupil participation and reinforce learning (Clemens quoted by Higgens and Beauchamp, 218). The students in the epilepsy classroom were low-attaining students, and the board, in conjunction with Prezi and Youtube videos, increased participation and engagement. Videos of real-life examples of the science topics (including pollination, bees, and underwater forests) were used to create discussion which added value to learning.\\n             The interactive white board was only used for brief periods of time as it was important for this group of students to be doing a variety of things during a lesson to maintain engagement. Many times, students would use individual iPads to further understand concepts in a lesson. The iPads were beneficial for learning as they offered a way to provide differentiated instruction. The students were all at different grades and abilities. Different apps and videos allowed them to understand concepts at their academic level. In addition, iPads were also beneficial to students with physical disabilities. Many times the students would sort things into categories, label diagrams, or complete puzzles relating to their unit. Some students in the classroom did not have use of one hand, so manipulating these things were much easier for them on the iPad. Often, students would play interactive math games during free time, which increased their math skills. Some math apps, however, were simply a review of concepts previously learned. These did not increase their math abilities if they did not already understand the concept.\\n            In addition to iPads, Students in the class also used individual laptops equipped with WordQ, a text-to-speech and speech-to-text program. This increased value in learning as it helped them to develop thoughts and complete sentences without worrying about the physical act of writing. It also decreased spelling anxiety since the words were written out for them.  The use of assistive technology, in this case, enhanced learning as it provided access for students and empowered them in their writing assignment.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\nHiggens, Steve.

Upon enrollment to this school all students are required to purchase a laptop and bring it to school on a regular basis.  In addition to the laptop, most students had a smartphone as well as an e-reader, iPad, or iPod.  Of the six classrooms, four were equipped with a SmartBoard.  The teachers who taught in classrooms with a SmartBoard used their laptops and their SmartBoard on a daily basis.  In the classes, which I observed that had SmartBoards, the technology was generally used effectively.  The SmartBoard was used to enhance learning by maximizing the use of student integration in lessons, as opposed to just using it as a projector or whiteboard.  In the classrooms that did not have a SmartBoard, mine included, the teachers hardly integrated any technology.  One of the classrooms had an overhead projector that was only used one time over the course of my placement.  The other teacher had a laptop that was only used for personal use.  Although I regularly integrated technology into my teaching, it was clear the students were not used to having technology present in their history classes.  This was made obvious through comments such as, “whoa, we get to watch a YouTube video?” and “Really, I need my laptop in history?” \\n         While the SmartBoard was used effectively most of the time, I felt that the use of laptops and other devices were not integrated effectively at all.  Considering how much access to technology the students had, I was surprised at their inability to use the technology effectively.  For instance, students would use their devices for personal use such as email and checking and updating a variety of social media sources.  However, when the students were asked to conduct research online, create a PowerPoint or Prezi using their laptops they lacked the necessary skills to effectively use the technology for academic purposes. \\n        Similarly, all the teachers and administrators at the school had smartphones that were used on a daily basis.  The school recently started a facebook page, which displays student work and their daily activities.  Consequently, teachers were always using their phones to take photos of students and upload them to the facebook page.  However, this was not used for academic purposes, mostly social media.  During my month of placement I did not observe a teacher using their smartphone for academic purposes. \\n        Ultimately, while there was an abundance of technology at the school, I was surprised at how infrequently and ineffectively it was being integrated for academic purposes.  Students were not allowed to bring smartphones to class and they were unable to skillfully use programs and applications for academic purposes.  When given a choice between a text and the Internet for research purposes, students almost always chose the text option.  I was surprised by my observations at this school.  Ultimately, I believe teachers need to provide students with the skills to masterfully integrate technology and demonstrate ways in which to integrate it for academic purposes. Teachers also need to authentically integrate technology into their programming on an ongoing basis in order to model the use of technology.  While the modeling was happening at this school, the scaffolding for independent use was lacking. ,\\n8,1104,2,1. Working Alone\\n2. Dropbox App ,\\n8,1105,2,My placement was at a private urban school in Toronto.  The school sets very clear and strict boundaries around technology usage in the school.  Students are not allowed to use cell phones or iPods in any context during school, including recess (but excluding exam study time, during which they are allowed to listen to their iPods).  They are, however, required to own a laptop for school purposes which is kept in their locker – they are only permitted to get it if the teacher has requested it previously or if the student asks.  The whole school is WiFi-enabled and all students use a student password to access the network.  Thus, student use of laptops is not prolific but it is very much a part of the school culture - students use their laptops for research, assignments, presentations, and their Student Led Interviews.  Teachers carry their cell phones on them at all times but rarely communicate with each other that way during class time.\\n  Of the 8 classrooms in the school, 2 have SMARTBoards and the library has a big screen TV (used weekly for the lunch time Film Club) and 4 library computers; the latter are not used very often, mainly because of the proliferation of laptops.  Few teachers use projectors – with the small class sizes (between 3 and 12), teachers without SMARTBoards make arrangements to switch classrooms, or show videos on their laptop.  The school maintains a small selection of school cameras, but all teachers have a smartphone and usually take school-related photos and videos with their phone.  Most classrooms have a blackboard or whiteboard that teachers use frequently; one teacher laminates plain white paper to use as portable whiteboards for student use. \\n  The school does not use an online educational system like Moodle or Edmodo to communicate between teachers, students, and parents.  Teachers mostly provide students with handouts.  The school maintains a website that is updated occasionally, and a newsletter is sent out by email every Friday with important dates and interesting news; more recently, the school began a Facebook account with frequent community and academic updates (mostly daily) to supplement the newsletter.  The Facebook account can only be edited by the school, and includes a tag called “Voice Faces”, which is comprised of head shots of students in the school (who remain unnamed).,\\n8,1106,4,Our app is called Explain Everything. It is a $2.99 and can be bought in the itunes app store. This is a screencasting presentation tool that can be used in the classroom. Of the many uses, it may be used by teachers to start a \"flipped classroom.\" In addition, teachers can have students complete review questions with recorded audio for their peers which can uploaded on the class website, youtube channel, or even a shared classroom dropbox folder. Files can be exported as a PDFs or image files or videos. Students can communicate with each other and respond to each others presentations, answers, or homework help. Students are able to import photos and videos from their device or cloud based storage. They can also take original photos and videos from within the app. This can be used to label diagrams, have ELL students take pictures around their community and record audio and label, give mini lessons to explain concepts or illustrate theories, etc  in a fun and interactive way. One of the key features of the app is that you can edit the presentations audio and video from within the app. \\n ,\\n8,1107,2,With a smartboard in both classrooms that I taught in during my February practicum, and almost every student with access to a personal laptop or a library computer, I was able to observe a lot of technology integration during this practicum. Having been in classrooms with no projectors or access to computers, this was a welcome change for me. The accessibility made it easy for teachers to integrate different mediums into their lessons. Images, videos and internet research were all worked into every day’s lessons. I believe that this is very important for student learning because many of these students will access information through the internet in their daily lives.  If any student wants to know anything about a topic, chances are they will turn to google, wikipedia and youtube as a source of information. When students have this way of learning modelled for them in classes (in research projects especially), this becomes an amazing opportunity for students to learn and to practice the skill set of online research and learning. Consistent access to technology in classes also meant that any resource on the internet could easily be brought into class without the hassle of booking laptop carts or projectors. This enabled a flexibility in teaching and learning that I appreciated.\\n  Rules were in place about using your personal technology device for academic use only during school hours, and the students were generally accountable to this. Ipods and mp3 devices were only to be used during silent study time and were not to be shared between students. I found that the students required little monitoring as they often had talks about responsibility, honesty and accountability for their actions. I found that far fewer students were deviant in their laptop use, and I would definitely attribute this to the school culture of mutual respect and accountability.  \\n  All in all, I think that the technology availability did add value to learning, because of what I said about making the learning in class relevant to how students interact with information outside of class. Additionally, the dynamic nature of online content allow students to access information in many different forms: videos, text, photos, diagrams, animations, interviews with experts, documentaries, etc. This will without a doubt enhance learning and appeals to differentiated instruction and multiple intelligences as well.  ,\\n8,1108,2,Working alone.,\\n8,1109,1,      For my final practicum I was placed in a Special Education Department in the TCDSB. I had the chance to spend time in their Resource, Multiple Exceptionalities and Gifted classrooms. The school policy regarding the use of technology was made explicitly clear by administration from the very beginning. An announcement by the Vice Principal reiterated the message found on the school’s website that “if students bring electronic devices to school that they power them off in instructional domains.”[1] Abiding to this rule was something the intermediate students had trouble with. It was common to hear teachers telling students to put away devices, not to take them out in the hallways or during recesses, and reminding them devices could be confiscated.\\n  By working with several teachers in the Special Education Department I observed various uses of technology. For example in the Resource class two teachers provide student support in two very distinct ways. One teacher has a more traditional method where she works individually with students, or with small groups of students around a table, using only the board, textbooks and manipulatives. The other teacher delivers instruction using only computers. Each computer has a list of bookmarked websites that contain skill and drill Math and Language activities. When students come in for extra help the teacher will instruct them to complete a specific sequence of online activities, tailoring to the targeted skills i.e., adding, subtracting or spelling. In my opinion the sole use of technology in this case does not support student learning because activities are repetitive and not challenging. Students practiced certain skills over and over but never had a chance to apply them in new contexts, nor were they able to explain their learning or work with others. I believe a blend between the two instructional approaches in the Resource room would enhance students’ overall motivation and learning. In this classroom however, I did see the benefits assistive technologies such as Kurzweil. Despite their physical and cognitive challenges, students could express their learning using this program.\\n  In the Multiple Exceptionalities class the SMARTBoard served many functions all of which improved student learning. The SMARTBoard provided visuals and audio for students as they sang their morning songs. It allowed them to practice their fine motor skills by interacting with the board, and selecting and dragging appropriate responses. For children with physical challenges this was a fun way for them to improve their fine motor skills. The students in this class also used IPads to increase the number of sight words and to enhance their memory and language skills. In this classroom I felt that technologies greatly enhanced student learning all the while keeping students engaged.\\n  This placement exposed me to various uses for technology in the classroom. Overall, technology added value to students’ learning when it provided access to learning that was not otherwise possible due to challenges or limitations, and when it was used in conjunction with other instructional approaches, not in place of instruction.\\n\\n[1]  TCDSB (2010).

The app, touching upon Geometry and Spatial Reasoning skills, presents players with images of both regular and irregular shapes on graph paper. There are five episodes in Slice It! and there are a multiple stages within each episode.\\n  Each stage presents a distinct shape or multiple shapes, and as the user advances, the stages become more challenging than the previous. The user is responsible for cutting the shape into equal parts all the while meeting specific conditions such as how many slices to make, and how many equal pieces need to be created from the slices. Once the image is sliced, the user is able to watch the whole shape be sliced apart into the individual parts, and receives feedback on the accuracy of the sliced pieces.\\n  Depending on the accuracy, the user may receive one to five star rewards. The accuracy of the slicing to create near to equal parts as well the accumulation of stars allows the user to access slicing hints if necessary in more challenging stages. The slicing results reveal whether the user has passed or failed the stage. In the case of failing the stage, the user may retry slicing the shape and apply the generated results to improve their next try. The user may also choose to advance to the next stage without retrying the failed stage, however, they will not be awarded stars for this.\\n  We believe that this app can support student learning by providing them with visual representations of what can sometimes be abstract concepts such as; symmetry, fractions, percentages, ratios, etc. Through the app users can visually see the effects of manipulating a whole object or shape to create smaller pieces of a whole. We see relevancy of this app and the cross curricular connections it can have in Mathematics, Language and Visual Arts.,\\n8,1111,1,I don\\'t think we cite the quotes from the interviews, just be clear on which of your participants said the quote.

While teachers in other schools with 1:1 laptop programs may still control when in a lesson students are allowed to use their laptops for specific activities, access to computers at BSS seems no different than access to notebooks or pencils. Teachers do not worry about competing to book “research periods in the computer lab” in advance. Rather, the Junior School has one laptop/iPad available for every three students, which students may borrow from carts in the hallway. In addition, every classroom has a SMART Board around five desktop computers. Thus, instructional time can be focused on learning, with students deciding what tools best suit their learning needs.\\n  Student preference for using computers or iPads often depended on the nature of the class activity. For text-heavy purposes and research, laptops were used because of the availability of word-processing software and a physical keyboard. iPads were preferred for most other activities, especially for those involving group collaboration. They are convenient for fast-paced activity first and foremost because of their portability and ability to be quickly turned on and off, making quick information retrieval and sharing highly efficient.\\n  The distinguishing feature of iPads which made them more of a necessity for many classes is its vast collection of apps, pre-installed by BSS’s ICT Integration Department. Many of these apps are programmed to carry out specialized tasks, such as a free chronophotography app called ActionShot that allowed science students to plot the trajectory of their own paper airplanes in flight by superimposing multiple photos captured every 250 milliseconds. During my practicum, the IT Department was in the process of installing Apple TV receivers in multiple classrooms. This would open huge possibilities for collaborative and presentational activity on iPads for both students and teachers, such as using multi-user whiteboard apps that allow users to conveniently show their thought processes. As well, the Apple TV avoids the “lag time” of having to export student work to a format that is compatible with the computer connected to the projector. For example, one app that significantly enriched student learning about airplane structure in my flight unit was Autodesk’s 123D Catch, whereby users take 20-40 photographs of an object from multiple angles to create a 3D model. Students could share their designs with the class and visualize the aerodynamics underlying their unique modifications to the paper airplane, rather than relying on a generic, static diagram from a Google Images search.\\n  All such instances of technology integration at BSS are made possible by a strong technological infrastructure, maintained by an IT Department of five members. Three ICT integrators collaborate with teachers to make technologically rich lessons possible by providing resources, offering professional development opportunities, and co-planning lessons with teachers.,\\n8,1115,2,I was placed at a middle school in TDSB, located in the Jane and Finch area, and has approximately 550 students from grades 6-8.  On the second floor of the school, I had access to a laptop cart of approximately 29 laptops that would be signed out by teachers on only my floor. Each floor had it\\'s own laptop cart, and there was a computer lab on the main floor with approximately 30 computers, though at least 10 of them were either in need of repair or not working effectively. There were at least two students from my classes who did not have an email address, and at least 5 who did not have access to the Internet at home. \\n  During my one opportunity to observe a class where my Associate Teacher (AT) taught Computers, she explained that she was not confident with technology and did not feel confident teaching students to use it when she lacked expertise. She did however, have experience using the MS Office Suite, and her lesson featured her reading aloud a short essay, which students were to type out as dictated. Students were limited by available technology (computers), and comfort with typing. Although there were a handful of students who were successful at this activity, the majority of the class had extreme difficulty. The pedagogical approach, as well as the technological literacy, was alarming.\\n  Once I had the opportunity to teach myself, there was little in place in terms of regulation of technology - there wasn\\'t a school based set of rules or a clear initiative, they generally referred back to TDSB policies. My AT seemed unsure, or at least unaware, and went to the TDSB website to find policies. When I asked if I could provide 10 minutes at the start of the class for them to check their email or have online free time, she said that they were not allowed to use the Internet for their personal use outside teacher supervised classwork. Despite being in keeping with the TDSB Code for Online Conduct policy, 4.2.1, which states that “If such [inappropriate] material is accessed by accident, the incident must be reported immediately to a teacher or appropriate authority” - I was worried about how excessive regulation might lead to further misuse. Given that Chris Spence claims: \"Technology is no longer an option; it\\'s an essential tool for learning. Our students have grown up in a digital world and it\\'s important that we effectively use technology to engage them in the classroom\" (2012), I was frustrated with what my school had to work with, and the attitude to technology, as I experienced it. \\n  From my experience, I saw that teachers lack the confidence with technology, and are not being pushed to integrate technology into their classes. Technology is being used as a way to type up essays and research (poorly) on the Internet. Based on the TDSB, “the appropriate use of technology in schools to enable powerful teaching practices has been increasingly recognized as a force in education to excite student learning” (Our Technology Infrastructure), however, if teachers are not given support in how to teach using technology, then they will revert back to the ways they use technology and will not encourage students to be creative. \\n  References:\\n  TDSB: Increasing Access to Technology at theTDSB:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/about_us/media_room/room.asp?show=allNews&view=detailed&self=34389\\n      TDSB: Our Technology Infrastructure:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteid=309&menuid=4374&pageid=3710\\n    TDSB Code of Online Conduct:\\nhttp://www.tdsb.on.ca/_site/ViewItem.asp?siteide=262&menuid=23189&pageid=20102\\n   ,\\n8,1116,1,Thanks Rob.

I have seen a range of technology available and used in different ways by staff and students.\\n  In one classroom where the teacher was very excited by technology use and its possibilities for the classroom, technology was integrated into every aspect of the literacy program. Students brought their own devices, which ranged from iPads to cellphones and laptops, which were all used daily. The classroom also had a set of laptops for students to borrow. There was pretty much a ratio of 1 piece of technology for each student. Further, there was a smart board that the teacher used daily. The use of technology had a natural flow in the classroom. My associate teacher had a personal iPad, which she used to post to the classroom blog and record anecdotal notes among other daily tasks. She was well versed in educational technology and gave me many resources to access online including her personal LiveBinder.\\n  Although the students had access to personal technology during class time, I did not see them abuse it. They were in grade 7 and 8 and were given free time to work on assignments using technology often unsupervised in the hallway. My AT was not worried about monitoring their online conduct. The students were using their technology for the right purposes – creating a glogster, prezi or powerpoint for a poetry anthology for example. I believe this is because they were engaged in what they were doing. Students enjoyed putting together their poetry anthology using a technology of their choice. They were excited to find pictures and videos that helped them present their poems. I saw students use their technology to benefit their learning - they were not distracted by it. I think the culture of the classroom was set up in a way that created a respect and an environment where appropriate technology use was the norm.\\n  In a different school but within the same board, I saw technology from the school available to staff and students, but my AT was not integrating it into her grade 4 program. She seemed worried about the inconveniences technology could bring to her classroom and was not interested in extending her own learning. There was a cart with a class set of netbooks available for student use, as well as a Smartboard to be shared between 3 classes. My AT took no initiative to learn how to use the smart board. She did not encourage students to use the netbooks, which she felt wasted a lot of time setting up and shutting down. Only students who were “truly struggling” with writing by hand were permitted to access netbooks for their summary writing. I persuaded my AT to let me create a class Edmodo for my students to access at home. I set it up and got each student logged on. The students participated on Edmodo and posted frequently. Students posted questions about homework, or comment on a game I had posted. Students would come to school the next day and would be excited to tell me about something they posted on Edmodo - I felt like it was bringing the learning inside the classroom home with them. I would say at least half of my students logged on to Edmodo each night. When I left, the class Edmodo stayed active because my AT learned how to use it. She continues to post homework and reading response questions online and the students are very engaged by it.\\n  It has become clear to me that availability of equipment is not the only factor that leads to use of technology in the classroom. The classroom teacher greatly influences whether or not technology will be used.,\\n8,1119,4,I had my final practicum in the Grade 2/3 Toronto District School Board (TDSB) Section 23 CATCH classroom at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). There were eight male students in my classroom, one special education teacher, and two Child and Youth Workers (CYWs). I quickly became aware of student and teacher use of technology that existed in the classroom and as well, I was made aware of the lack of technology in the classroom and the potential it could have in this special education environment.\\n  When walking into the classroom, two computers were visible, one on the teacher’s desk in the corner and the other on the Child and Youth Workers desk. These two computers were mainly used by the adults in the room. The teacher used her computer constantly for such things as attendance, lesson planning, and report card writing. CYWs needed constant access to these computers for report writing. Three other computers were available for student use in a group room down the hall from the classroom. Each day, during the literacy centre that involved technology, a pair of students would get the opportunity to work on the computer to access the BookFLIX program where they would listen to a book being read to them as they followed along with the highlighted words. Students had the opportunity to use headphones for this. Depending on student behavior and the availability of staff, students would either have to be logged onto the teacher and CYW computers to complete their literacy centre technology activity or they would go with one adult to the group room to work on the computers there. Students also had the opportunity to use the computers during reading and writing activities where they could use the assistive technology program, Read and Write Gold, for literacy support. Again, not all students had access to the technology at the same time due to limited technological resources for the classroom.\\n  There were only three iPads available for the students in the classroom. Being able to use an iPad was a privilege. It was during occasional math and language periods that the teacher would designate certain students to use the iPad for learning purposes. The iPads were equipped with previously downloaded Math or Language games that appropriately linked to the curriculum at hand. Student iPad use needed to be closely monitored as students would easily access other games and applications. Some of the students had their own iPads and they were only allowed to play them after school and once they got on the bus. Depending on their behaviour and on the amount of chips accumulated during the school week, students would have the option of using their own iPads on Fun Friday.\\n  There were only whiteboards in the classroom. There was access to an overhead projector but it was not used during my practicum. My associate teacher expressed her frustrations with the lack of technology and associated resources for this highly specialized classroom. As a Special Education specialist with many related teaching experiences, my associate teacher expressed that a SmartBoard would be highly beneficial for these students in this type of classroom.\\n  I accompanied my Associate Teacher to an iPad workshop where Section 23 educators gathered to share useful iPad games and applications. An instructor was also present to share with the group specific games and applications that could be beneficial to some of the unique classrooms. This workshop was mildly beneficial. Unfortunately, the games and applications presented were not grade level appropriate for my students.\\n ,\\n8,1120,1,  Application Name: Flipboard\\n  Category: News\\n  Price: Free\\n  Link: http://flipboard.com\\n  Flipboard is available for free on the iPhone, iPad, Android devices, Kindle Fire and NOOK.

I had had a practicum at this school last year, however the change in use of technology over the past year was outstanding.  The area in which this middle school is located is extremely diverse, with many of its students living in subsidized housing, newcomers to Canada, from affluent parts of the neighbourhood and so on.  Upon entering the school it became extremely apparent that the school had put an incredible amount of funding into its technology.  There was a Smartboard located in almost every classroom, and those classrooms that did not have Smartboards as of yet, were going to be receiving one in the near future.  In the classrooms that had Smartboards, including mine, they were used effectively.  They became far more than a glorified whiteboard and were successful in incorporating student engagement and active participation throughout all lessons.  From mathematics to History, the teacher and myself used the Smartboard.  It was clear that the students had become quite accustomed to using the boards, due to their wealth of knowledge of its functions and capabilities.  I knew this because as I was conducting a lesson the students would say “Miss, why don’t you pull up the tools on the laptop?” or “You can use the pen to highlight too.”  Not only was it great to see their understanding of technology, it was a great way for me to build my students’ confidence by learning from them.\\n            Along with the Smartboard, there are a number of laptop carts available within the school.  I believe there are 2, however, I was fortunate enough to have one of the carts in my classroom throughout my entire practicum.  As well, my AT had access to her own personal laptop for report card writing, lesson planning, and researching.  For a large portion of the classes students were able to use laptops to type up their work and conduct research as well.  The students ability to type and navigate on the laptops was extremely high, however, it became clear that their foundational ability to spell was not at grade level.  This was very interesting to me that the students were able to use the laptops without issues.  However, they were not able to construct a clear sentence without spelling and grammar errors.  That aside, for the sake of discussing technology, the students were able to conduct research, put PowerPoint presentations together, create storyboards, and navigate the laptop’s many programs.  The students requested to use the technology as much as possible for a wealth of reasons.  Many of the students did not have technology at home, therefore, their ability and option to use it at school was in a sense, a motivational tool for them.\\n            Similarly, all the teachers and administrators in the school were extremely well versed in the technology that the school had readily available.  In addition to the school’s technology, students and staff had their own personal devices, mainly smartphones.  Their phones were not allowed in the classroom, or to be used during school time, which included recess and lunch.  However, it was interesting to see some of the teachers using their phones for social media purposes, to take photographs, or play music during class time.  At no point in time did I observe a teacher using their phones for academic purposes.  I found this made students more inclined to bring their phones to class, even though they were not allowed to use them.\\n            With all of the technology available within the school, students were able to achieve a great deal of successful research and assignment completion.  They were well versed in the uses of each of the technologies available.  If the students were ever given a choice of using the laptops or not, 99% of the time they chose to use the technology.  The teachers at the school did a tremendous job of integrating technology into their lessons on a daily basis and were extremely effective in involving students in this technological journey.  However, although the use of technology was extremely effective, I believe teachers should model the rules of the school and avoid using their personal devices for personal reasons, and not academic purposes.  Teachers need to be role models for their students, and if the students are expected to not use their personal devices in class, then they should avoid it as well.  Conclusively, I found that this middle school was great for modeling the use of technology and integrating it into their daily lessons.  Thus developing the students ability to successfully use multiple forms of technology.          ,\\n8,1122,1,Finger-print Painting (Gr. 5-8 DD) @ Beverley Public School \\n  Enjoy!,\\n8,1123,1,Me and Jamie will be presenting the app StoryKit - an app that allows students to create and share their own digital stories,\\n8,1124,2,During my second practicum I taught in a grade 7 gifted class. Honestly at first I found myself extremely frustrated with the lack of technology in the classroom. The extent of the technology consisted of a lap top cart that was shared amongst the four classes on the 2nd floor. I tried teaching my lessons in science and math without technology performing experiments and physical demonstrations, but this wasn\\'t always possible for the specific subject matter. I am not the biggest fan of the blackboard, and I found myself re-writing the same information for my rotary science classes. A simple power point would facilitate my lessons much more efficiently.\\n  Although during practicum you abide to the routines already established, I took it upon my self to incorporate at least a little bit of technology into the classroom. I borrowed a projector from one teacher, speakers from another, and the necessary cords I needed to conduct a power point. Once managing to acquire all the equipment, I realized that the screen was located behind my AT\\'s desk where students were unable to view it. I was allowed to rearrange the the desks, and ended up using a piece of white chart paper as a projector screen. After jumping through hoops in getting simple technology into my classroom it was evident that it was well worth it. The technology reinforced student learning, was used as a classroom management tool, and engaged the creative minds of the students in the gifted program.\\n  During my first week of practicum classroom management was my greatest concern. The simple technology of an overhead proved to help with this issue. Students were interested in what was on the screen. For class A I performed a lesson on Solar Energy with the use of the blackboard and images on a sheet in front of each student. I found that I was often guiding students to stay on task and that they would lose focus much more easily. When I used the projector with the same lesson plan for class B, they were much more focused on the vibrant pictures that the entire class was looking at together. With just the blackboard they easily tuned out, the projector was a tool I used that captured their attention.\\n  Using the projector to show short YouTube clips on Conventional Energy Sources was a great way to reinforce student learning. In this particular lesson I posted the exact energy diagrams from the textbook on the screen. I would first go over the diagram as a class, the students would then go over it individually or in small groups, then we would conclude with a short clip to further understandings. My students enjoyed the clips most of all, and I heard comments such as \"o that it enters the reactor like that\". The projector simply made the topic Energy Sources much more engaging then the textbook.\\n  Technology is an important factor in teaching in the 21st century, there are 4 year old kids who are able to work an I-pad better then some adults. I truly believe that technology can make both lesson plans better as well as teachers. When leaving my practicum my AT discussed how she would like to use the projector and different programs more in the future. She observed her students positive response and was pleased with the outcome. With this specific group of students they all flourished with new Ideas and different forms of technology. With many different working habits and behaviors, putting up different challenges on the projector provided great extensions to assignments, activities, and learning goals.        \\n   ,\\n8,1125,2,We will be reviewing Comic Life, available on the iPad and iPhone for $4.99\\n  This is an app that allows you to create your own comic strips and share them with the whole class!,\\n8,1126,2,Name: Comic Life\\n  Price: $4.99 for iPad\\n  Link: https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/comic-life/id432537882?mt=8\\n\\nDescription: Comic Life is an application designed for creating your own comic book using real life photographs from your photo library.

It was interesting for me to see if the use of technologies has changed in the school over the course of the year, be it school wide, teacher use, or student use. The reality is, nothing has changed.\\n  Most classrooms are equipped with a SMARTboard. That being said, they are also still equipped with the traditional chalk board which I found still more popular among the teachers even with the oversized, interactive, touch-screen computer hanging in the classes.  The reason for this I’m not sure, but I can surmise that since it is an older school (literally an older building and teachers and staff older as well) that as long as the older, traditional means are still available (i.e. the chalk board and over head projectors), then the traditional means they will continue to use.\\n  Specifically now, my AT did in fact make use of her SMARTboard both this time around and the last. However, after seeing how my AT used it in this years fall placement, I realize how little she really knows about its nuances and true capabilities. For her purposes it acts as a glorified overhead, one that does not hum nor leaves a marker residue on one’s fingers. Although, I give her credit for trying to bring it in (now more often than before) and even allow her students to interact with it as well.\\n  My AT does a movie trailer project with the grade 8 students, after learning about genre and what goes into a movie trailer. For this project, the students use iphones, ipads, lap tops, video cameras, whatever they need, to film their very own movie trailers. I have seen students create and utilize their own green screens, and add special effects- it is all so amazing what they can do, and this process allows them to utilize both their creativity and their desire to utilize technology in the school.\\n  The general rule at school for all students is that phones may come to school, but they are to stay in their lockers over the course of the day. For middle school students who go off campus at lunch, they may take their phones, and as soon as the bell goes at the end of the day, their phones are allowed to come out. Interestingly, in my two practicum at the, at the intermediate level, I have never seen the phone rule being an issue. I have never seen a cell phone in my classroom, or in the halls aside from the end of the day or right after lunch.\\n  Majority of the middle school students have their computers and they may bring them to class when they please, as long as they adhere to the teachers’ rules regarding their use of them. During lunch, which is spent in spent in the classrooms prior to going outside, no computers are allowed. However, if students choose not go outside for recess, they may stay in with a teacher on duty and use their computers.\\n  In my observations of the use of technology in the school, the rules seem to be a good fit. I have yet to see or hear of any problems, nor have I been interrupted by a cell phone or caught a student texting. Sometimes if the students are doing class work on their computers, I have seen them playing a game, but I have never had to ask more than once to refrain from doing so.\\n  Generally speaking, the classroom I was in was not “advanced” in incorporating technology, per se, however nor was it opposed it. I found there was a pretty god balance between using technology and not using it- in such a way that the students respected it. ,\\n8,1128,1,  Practicum Observation # 2\\nAlicia Krumholz\\nWalking into my classroom on the first day I was instantly overwhelmed. I noticed a Smartboard sitting in the corner of the room. While this sight would excite most of my peers, I was petrified. Before this practicum I had never used the Smartboard and had sworn it off as my enemy. I was happy to learn that although my teacher had the privilege of a Smartboard in this classroom, he never used it. By the middle of the second week I was convinced by my peers to try it out.\\n  Wow! It’s an amazing tool and so easy to use, I incorporated it into so many lessons after that initial point. However, I did notice that it was hard to involve all students in the lesson when getting some to interact with the board. After using the Smartboard a few times I developed a solution to this problem. My favorite use of the Smartboard was for consolidation. I found it to be a wonderful tool to use with a small group of students at a time. Consequently, when students were doing seatwork, I would call up a 3-4 students to complete the consolidation activity. This allowed me to keep anecdotal notes of student progress and highlighted to me who was struggling and needed some more support. My teacher was really inspired by these activities and asked that I teach him how to use the Smartboard.\\n  Another interaction I had with technology in my practicum was during an individual assignment in literacy. The students were tasked with researching and writing a biography on a famous Canadian. Students were allowed to bring in their own technology from home pending the permission of their parents through a form. Although many students were able to bring in equipment I saw a lot of jealousy in my grade 5 classroom. Many students were visibly upset an expressed a sadness in having to use the “old school computers”, while others used their new fast iPads. This is a constant concern I have had with students bringing in their own technology into the classroom. How do you explain to other students that this is a fact of life? Further, an interesting dichotomy exists, in allowing students to bring in their own technology other students get upset, but, if those students did not bring in their own devices, the school did not have a class set of laptops for use of all the students.\\n  Although technology has its benefits I believe there are still many wrinkles that need to be ironed out, like equity, before educators can integrate technology in a meaningful way. ,\\n8,1129,1,Student behaviour and work skills tracking application,\\n8,1130,1,  Post Practicum Observation #2\\n                I had the pleasure of working with an associate teacher that had a genuine interest in integrating technology into the classroom and curriculum. There was an abundant use of technology by both students and teachers in this class. Our homeroom was located in the library, allowing students to have regular access to its 7 desktop computers. Students were encouraged to use the computers during language classes for many purposes including research, writing, and preparing presentations. The school also had a portable Mac cart that contained enough MacBooks for each student to use. A wireless router came with the Mac cart and supplied a Wi-Fi signal that students could connect to and access the Internet. Our class regularly booked the laptops for students to use in our language classes.\\n                Other technologies in the classroom included daily use of the SMARTBoard and ELMO projector for morning activities and lessons in math and language classes. Students were regularly called upon to interact with the SMARTBoard during lessons and instruction.\\n                My associate teacher was a member of TACIT, the TDSB’s Technology and Curricular Integration Team, and was an avid supporter and implementer of blended learning. An online classroom was set up on the TDSB “e-learning” website and served as a forum for students to discuss various topics, share documents, submit assignments, access supplemental resources, watch instructional videos (Khan Academy and teacher produced), receive feedback, and organize work. Students were regularly assigned to read a short article or watch a video posted on the online classroom website and the following class would incorporate the learning from it. My associate instructor would spend a large portion of prep-time updating content, tracking usage, giving feedback, and monitoring the e-learning online classroom website. The students seemed to enjoy using the online classroom as it served as a permanent resource for lessons, assignments, and grades.\\n                Overall, my experience working with an associate teacher that regularly used technology was refreshing and encouraging. As a teacher that hopes to integrate technology into my daily teachings, I was able to make note of valuable TDSB resources, as well as the benefits of implementing blended learning in the classroom.,\\n8,1131,1,  Post Practicum Observation #2\\n                I had the pleasure of working with an associate teacher that had a genuine interest in integrating technology into the classroom and curriculum.

My associate teacher was not tech savvy and the classroom only had two computers and 5 laptops. Due to the limited amount of computers available in each classroom, students had to borrow laptops from other classrooms to complete assignments. For Language class, the limited amount of computers was not an issue because they used the daily five for language, allowing students to work on other tasks if a laptop or computer was unavailable. However, the lack of laptops would make it difficult to research material or type good copies of written work for any other subject.\\n              Although the classroom itself had a limited supply of technology, Redstone had a large amount of technological equipment available. There was an iPad cart available to any teacher if they signed for it in the library. Personally, I signed out the iPads and made them available to my students when I was teaching my science lessons on renewable and non-renewable resources. The iPads allowed students to use the internet and research topical and pertinent information. Since technology was not widely used in the classroom, the iPads were seen as a treat. I often saw students fooling around with the iPads; taking pictures of themselves and making videos. I believe iPads have the potential to be a powerful tool for learning as students can easily interact (through touching the screen) with the iPad. However, it is important that a teacher not only uses iPads in class, but also models and periodically monitors appropriate behaviour when using the iPads. They should be treated as learning tools and not toys.\\n              Redstone also had a number of SmartBoards available for teachers and students. Although my associate teacher was not a big fan of using the SmartBoard in her lessons, I used the SmartBoard quite regularly throughout the practicum. To enhance my mathematics unit, I used the SmartBoard everyday for demonstrating how to translate, rotate, and reflect shapes. I also uploaded various teaching games (Who Wants to be a Millionaire and Jeopardy) for science and math which the students really enjoyed. The SmartBoard itself is a fantastic tool for both teachers and students to use because it is very engaging for students and anxiously came to the front of the class to interact with it. This interaction encouraged participation and allowed students to better learn and apply course content. I enjoyed creating unique lessons for my students and seeing them very engaged in the material they were learning.\\n              After using and observing laptops, SmartBoards, and iPads in the classroom, I could readily see and appreciate their benefit. In particular, the SmartBoard was extremely beneficial as I would have had difficulties teaching and demonstrating rotations and reflections without it. Using my words to explain how to rotate an object is difficult for me, but I was able to teach it using SmartBoard technology. In order to see the benefits, technology needs to be used often by both teachers and students. If technological equipment is not modelled properly and used appropriately, there is no way that teachers and students can truly beneficially experience what technology can bring to a classroom.,\\n8,1134,1,My placement was in a grade 6-8 Special Education classroom with the TDSB. Technology was always present in and out of the classroom environment. The school is located in a diverse racial, cultural and socio-economic neighborhood. Despite varying economic situations, all of my students owned cell phones, and they even made fun of my ‘old fashioned’ black berry. Despite their obvious presence, students were strictly forbidden to use their cell phones in class and their use was limited to before school, at lunch or after school.\\n         The administration has allocated a vast amount of funds to enhancing technology use in the school. In the last two years the school has purchased four Promethean boards, and a set of twenty i-Pads for the library. There is also a computer lab and two mobile mac labs in the school. Naturally, technology practice varied around the school depending on teacher’s experience and comfort level.\\n         My students seemed to have technology integrated throughout the school day. We had a Promethean board in the classroom, and it was used as the main instructional tool. My associate teacher was still exploring and struggling to learn how to use the Promethean to facilitate a more interactive learning environment, but she did use it consistently. Furthermore, because of the students individual education needs there was a computer for each student in the class. However, despite the fact that I was working in a special education classroom, I was surprised that Read and Write Gold seemed to be the only adaptive technology used.\\n         I did go to my student’s rotary classes and found that technology was used throughout the day. The library utilized their new i-Pads to facilitate interactive learning activities. The music teacher also used the i-Pads to create sound bites and mix songs. The science and technology teacher used the smart board as his main instructional tool.\\n         In my discussions with staff members there seemed to be a general reluctance when it came to technology. For example, I over heard one teacher telling the staff that her daughter was allowed to use her cellphone in class, because she went to a BYOD school, and most staff members were appalled and saw that as a classroom management disaster. Overall despite the integration and presence of technology I believe teachers need further professional development and guidance to first gain acceptance of technology as a valid learning tool and second in making it supportive of the learning instead of just a fancy and expensive instructional tool.,\\n8,1135,2,Price: Free!\\nCategory: Photo & Video\\nSize: 46.1 MB\\nDeveloper: Autodesk Inc.\\n  Download/Launch page: http://www.123dapp.com/catch#downloadCatch\\nDemo and 11-Step Procedure: http://apps.123dapp.com/catch/\\n  Developed by major CAD software corporation Autodesk, 123D Catch is an application that creates 3D models by seamlessly stitching together multiple photographs of an object taken at various angles.

When I saw Pierre Laporte Middle School, I didn’t think I’d have much to work with. It is located in a low SES area, and my previous experience was that it was affluent parent councils that put the tech in the classroom.\\n                To my surprise, my gifted class had 8 macbooks and a smartboard. It doesn’t sound like much, but it was the PERFECT number of devices for 17 students. These 8 macbooks weren’t enough for my classes of 28 students which I saw during rotary: I had to book our school’s “Mobile Computing Strategy” laptop cart (a TDSB initiative which looks like an armoured tank with massive fans on it to cool all the PCs down). Luckily, the cart was not in consistent high demand like in the other schools I worked at.\\n                My students knew how to use various programs on the macs, including music and video editing software. They all had internet access at home as well. In fact, they begged me for my email so I created a misterelgeries email so they could continue to ask me questions/keep in touch, both to protect my privacy and my sanity.\\n                My AT was encouragingly better at tech than what I expected for a teacher with a SmartBoard. She even gave me some music lessons she had ordered that utilized the SmartBoard.\\n                One concern I continue to have is how to optimally deliver lessons when some students may not have the internet at home. I knew my homeroom students had access, and I really appreciated the freedom of doing internet-based follow-up work or pre-work. It was so good, that I would feel bad retarding a whole class from this efficient process for the sake of 1 or 2 students that don’t have internet access at home. It’s sad to say, but those students may just have to come in to school early, go to the school library, or worst case scenario, the public library. It is a lot to ask and may cause a serious imposition for the parents, but it is the only viable option in light of delivering a less efficient curriculum than possible. If it was practically impossible, I’d just sacrifice some of my lunch so they could internet whatever I assign (yes, I just used internet as a verb).,\\n8,1138,3,\"I\\'ll trade you my iPad time for more desktop computers, heck, I\\'ll trade you the smartboad that doesn\\'t work too well for more desktop computers, OR a whole set of ipads for my class\"\\n  Technology in my treatement centre placement was a juggling act.  Desktop computers were used just as much as a student learning tool (scribing, research, etc) as it was a therapeuitc tool (able to do independent study, music when stressed, a chance to play a game and check out).  Our smart board wa san interactive learning tool, but one that only worked for two weeks due to being unplugged (how did we not see that!?).\\n  I used my ipad in this practicum and it was the first time the students had seen one in use by a teacher before, and my teacher did not use one, nor did I see them in use at school.  The students recognized that I was using the ipad and using it to keep track of marks and lessons and things to show them.  I used a modified web-cam for my small class to show them works in progress that I really liked, and they loved seeing it in action, but I think it was unfamiliar enough, that they didn\\'t take it into account as much (well, more chicken legs apppeared on their sculptures than before I showed the chicken leg sculpture).  Technology for me was about connecting with the students, making things entertaining and useful for them.  Wherease technology in the class (aside from our smart-board) was really seen as either a tool, a toy or an afterthought.  I didn\\'t aks my AT about her thoughts on technology and how to integrate it, and I showed her some interesting apps on the ipad that piqued he rinterest, but her repsonse wasn\\'t to adapat it right away.\\n  I feel like this probably has to do with the facility, the focus in the centre was on treatment of the students with their educaiton coming second.  I can only wonder what it would do for students and treatment if technology had been integrated in more for therapeutic purposes as well as educaitonal ones.,\\n8,1139,1,Here\\'s what we came up with last year:\\n  Professor\\nPhotocopy Fiend Award (most likely to make use of our photocopy fees)\\nPub Crawler Award (most likely to grab a drink with us)\\nE-mail Quick Draw Award (most likely to respond to an e-mail instantly)\\nFashionista Award (most likely to dress to impress)\\n  Student\\nEarly Bird Award (most likely to arrive to class early)\\nPepper-Happy Award (made the best use of Pepper)\\nFuture OISE Prof Award (most likely to become a professor at OISE)\\nStudent Leadership Award (most involved in building community, improving the program and empowering students)\\n\"One of the Kids\" Award (most likely to be mistaken for a student)\\nFuture Principal Award (most likely to join the administration)\\nDangerous Minds Award (can handle any classroom)\\nGlass Half-Full Award (always has a positive outlook)\\n  -Cak,\\n8,1141,1,  During this practicum, I had the opportunity to teach grade 9 and 10 English at a TCDSB high school. On my observation days, I was impressed with the amount of technology being used in my AT’s classrooms as students were using laptops from a rolling lab to complete ISU’s and were allowed to listen to music on their own personal devices with headphones on while they worked independently if the students and the teacher felt it could help them focus on the task. In addition to this, not only did the classroom have a projector mounted on the ceiling facing one wall, but a smart board mounted on the opposite wall. Every classroom in the English hall was outfitted with the same and just down the hall was the most amazing computer lab I have ever seen with over 60 iMacs, amazing audio and video equipment, DSLR cameras and more. \\n  Needless to say, I came into my practicum with the idea that my students and I would be using technology easily each day (I had been using Smart Boards in my last two practicums), but on my first day I was proven wrong as I clearly hadn’t observed closely enough.  Though the smart board was mounted, it had not been turned on since it was mounted over a year ago because the power cord wasn’t long enough to reach the outlet and there was no extension cord,  none of the English teachers received training on how to use it and none had found the time to figure it out after school themselves or purchase an extension cord. The ones who were using it were actually wheeling in their own personal projector and laptop and just using it as a white screen to project on to (why they weren’t using the one mounted on the ceiling is beyond me).  Teachers were also not given laptops and none of the classrooms had desktop computers, so they were frustrated with the expectation that they had to provide their own laptops to use as well.  For the first two weeks of practicum, I tried to use the Smart Board but the speakers wouldn’t work and it wouldn’t calibrate – it was essentially a projector and screen.  I spent those weeks asking if someone could come in to look at it and though my AT tried to help me trouble shoot, it seemed like it was going to continue to just collect dust.  Then suddenly in my third week of practicum a technical assistant showed up out of nowhere during school and started working on it. Again, like my last practicum, I did not let him leave the class until everything was working perfectly.  My AT then explained that I was lucky that I saw him during school hours and could trouble shoot with him because technical assistants often come and go without the issues being fully solved or without speaking to teachers so they never learn what the issues are and how to solve anything themselves (with the fault likely lying in many factors, not just the technician). In addition to challenges with the class’ equipment, to book a rolling lab or a computer lab often took four weeks notice which was incredibly limiting and even problematic because I can’t imagine a teacher knowing what exactly their day plans are four weeks in advance.\\n  After it was fixed and I began using it as an actual Smart Board I was surprised to hear that most of the students had never seen a teacher use one, even though a lot of their teachers had one for over a year. To me it is such a shame because I know how expensive they are and I know how much my students enjoyed using one.  I do have to give my AT credit though because he was using Twitter with his Grade 12 Writer’s Craft class as an experiment and after I showed him my classroom wiki (which was my experiment for the semester!) he decided to continue using it with the students after I left as well. I know that he would love to use more technology in his classes, so I wish there was more PD available for him to learn more, outside of what I tried to teach him or even just more consideration on the tools that are invested in (like a smart board but no computer or power cord).\\n  The other piece of technology that I saw everywhere in our school was cellphones. As they are high school students, I think many more students than I was expecting had their own personal cell phones. They were allowed to bring it to school and while I’m not sure what the exact policies were for students using it in the hallways or at lunch, they were everywhere and being used all the time.  I appreciated the fact that my AT allowed students to use their cell phones for music or to use apps, but I found that because the school and my teacher had such flexible (maybe even nonexistent) cell phone policies in place I was always stuck battling with students over their phone. In the end, I welcomed students’ use of cell phones to listen to music during silent writing time, record homework, and go on our class wiki, but I often felt frustrated because I couldn’t actually control what students were doing with their phones (i.e. as soon as we were wrapping up class students who recorded homework with their phone would be busy doing that, while others would try to convince me that they were doing the same while they were really just texting.) When I left the school I suggested to my AT that more PD could be done around technology and that clearer expectations were needed for students use of technology, but I hope that my examples at least inspired him and the other teachers in my department to think more about using technological and online tools (for example, dropbox).,\\n8,1142,1,Attached you will find the P.064  (Policy) as reference for Progressive Discipline.\\n  -Lorne, Ed & Jamie,\\n8,1144,1,              I spent my second practicum this year at Pierre Laporte Middle School, in the Toronto District School Board.  When it came to the use of technology during class time, my associate teacher often used the SMARTboard as an instructional tool and students often used the computers during their library period.  My associate teacher often used YouTube to show video clips that were tied to the lessons.  Although I didn’t see them used during my stay at the school, several assistive technologies were also mentioned during staff meetings, with a brief tutorial held on how to best use them.  I also saw students using listening centers in some classrooms during literacy periods.  Cell phones and personal electronic devices were typically not permitted in class, but from time to time, my associate teacher allowed the students to bring them in to assist their work on certain assignments.\\n                       I noticed that the majority of students were familiar with technology and many owned personal electronic devices.  I saw many iPods, mp3 players, and cell phones.  Although cell phones were not allowed during class times, I often saw students using cell phones and iPods in the hallways and during recess times.  My students often spoke of technology and mentioned the use of computers and video game systems at home.  Through my experiences this practicum, it was clear to me that technology played a big role in the lives of the students that I was working with.  Not only was it a popular topic of conversation, but also the activities that they chose to engage in during free time, both at school and outside of school, were often connected in some way to the use of technology.  ,\\n8,1145,1,Thank you for your edits! I am happy you approve of the title :) I will check the quotations out with Kim. \\nAll the best\\nShira,\\n8,1146,1,  My second practicum came with surprises and adjustments. Following three successful placements, where I was fortunate to heavily integrate technology; I suddenly found myself struggling in a placement with minimal technologies. During my latest teaching experience at Wilclay Public School in the York Region District School Board, the technological presence was at a bare minimum. Some classes even continued to use overhead projectors, while only two classes had available Smartboard. This struggle led to my personal initiatives to incorporate technology into teaching, and learning. By incorporating an elmo, Edmodo and Prezi, I am confident that I have independently incorporated technology into my teaching.\\n  During the beginning of my practicum, I was focused on observations, and following the routines of my Associate Teacher. While I was working with grades seven and eight on rotary, I learned that most classes did not have contemporary technologies in the classroom. Most classes possessed an overhead projector as their primary technological resource. I had difficulty planning lessons with the possibility of teaching without technology. After asking my Associate Teacher for possible technological resources, she brought an Elmo into the class as a daily device. This device lessened my anxiety of teaching without technology but led to an epiphany towards technology. I learned that my unrest with teaching without technology came as these devices made both teaching and learning simpler.\\n  Later into my placement, I came across experiences regarding communication with parents. In past teaching experiences, I found that online communication with parents through blogs or websites have been efficient and useful. In this class, communication was through printed newsletters. This practice led to notes being sent back and forth between parents to clarify wording. I learned that these communications would have been made clearer through online communication.\\n  Towards the end of my placement, I began to integrate technology into every lesson. By using the Elmo and Smartphones, I had the ability to extend the learning outside the classroom. I was able to share videos and websites when they became relevant to the context of the lesson. Additionally, I chose to integrate technology into an assessment of learning. I created a co-curricular evaluation for Media Literacy and Mathematics using Prezi. This assignment was found to be engaging and created self-motivation. By creating an evaluation that linked technology with curriculum expectations,\\n  In summary, my latest teaching experience emphasized that technology must be integrated into ones education. A lack of technology negatively impacts both the student and teacher. Without sufficient technology, it limits a teachers’ ability to communicate effectively with students and parents. Furthermore, the lack of technology restricts learning as lessons and assessments lack real-world connectivity and engagement. This final placement has been eye opening. While every technology may not always be accessible; I am certain that I will make an effort to consistently integrated any available resources in order to engage and provoke student learning.\\n ,\\n8,1147,4,Name: ClassDojo\\nPrice:  Free!\\nLink:   Android: Search Google Play or visit www.classdojo.com/android\\n            Apple: Search the Apple App Store or visit www.classdojo.com/ios\\n            Other devices: visit www.classdojo.com/mobile\\nDescription:\\nClassDojo is a website / mobile app that teachers can use to help motivate students, promote positive behaviour, and track student learning skills.

Users can create their own virtual card decks or download decks created by other people. These decks can contain text, pictures, or audio. Anki is adaptive in the sense that once you have mastered a card, it will appear less frequently. Conversely, if you are experiencing difficulty with a card, it will appear within a minute or less to increase the likelihood of memorization. \\n  Some uses include: language acquisition, studying for medical and law exams, remembering chords for guitar playing, or fine tuning knowledge of geography.\\n  Means’ Categories and Bruce & Levin’s Categories:\\nAnkiweb does not fit into the Bruce & Levin’s categories. It is neither media for expression, nor for communication, and it also doesn’t fit as media for construction as flashcards remain a rote memorization-type task. (Levin & Bruce, 2001) However, since Ankidroid is so versatile, it falls under two of Means’ categories for educational technology: technology as a tutor and as a tool. It is partially a tutor, because though the user isn’t necessarily being taught new facts or concepts while using Ankidroid, he or she will be memorizing them, which is definitely classified as learning new material (what you did not know before, you will know post-memorization – that is, you will be able to recall and deliver this information to working memory from long-term memory). Ankidroid can also be categorized as a tool. Though its purposes are educational, its primary use as a memorization tool isn’t limited to the classroom. It can be used for many personal uses such as brushing up on a language, or memorizing people’s names and faces.  (Means, 1994)\\n  TPACK Framework: \\n  The TPACK framework references the ability for teachers to skillfully draw upon their “teacher toolkit” of different types of knowledge. Though teachers may know about each different type of knowledge (technological, pedagogical, content), their use of technology for education is limited by their ability to apply it in the way that it will be most effectively used. (Koehler)\\n  “knowledge of what makes concepts difficult or easy to learn and how technology can help redress some of the problems that students face; knowledge of students’ prior knowledge and theories of epistemology; and knowledge of how technologies can be used to build on existing knowledge to develop new epistemologies or strengthen old ones” (Koehler)\\n  Ankidroid has many features that can be customized, therefore allowing teachers to use it as a technology that can assist a student’s understanding through the TPACK framework – as mentioned in the previous quote. For example, when teaching about the cell in Science, some students may have trouble remembering the different organelles and their functions, or the stages of mitosis and their names. Teachers who have content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, can then use Anki to present the information to students who need help memorizing terms. The customizable features mean that images, audio, video, or a combination of all three can be used to help students connect with and internalize the data in the way that best suits their needs.\\n      Works Cited:\\nKoehler, M.

This practicum experience was very different from my other experiences since I was teaching high school mathematics for the first time. St. Maximilian Kolbe CHS offers a new facility with access to a variety of technologies for both teacher and student use. The mathematics department had access to its own class set of iPads, graphing calculators, and SMART boards in each of it\\'s classrooms. A large library was also available to students and teachers, which included brand-new Apple and PC computers, scanners, and LCD projectors. The school was equipped with wireless Internet for both student and teacher access. Each day, lessons were prepared on the SMART Board and graphing calculators were available to differentiate instruction for students who preferred a more hands-on approach to mathematical concepts. I had the opportunity to create a website for my students which included SMART board lesson plans, instructional videos to reinforce concepts, and extra math practice. Handouts were posted to the course website before class for students who wished to access material in advance. Through the course website, students were able to engage in dialogue about the material and post questions or comments for the teacher. The discussion board served as a useful opportunity to answer questions for students and share resources.\\n  During my lessons, I frequently asked students to use their PEDs to access the website Poll Everyone. Furthermore, a link to the student textbook was available online for easy access. The website served as a formative assessment tool for students to readily self-assess their own understanding of course material. In addition, I made use of the class iPads to engage students in math activities and interactive games. The iPads were engaging for struggling leaners and provided a fun and collaborative way to reinforce concepts for all students. Gizmos were also implemented on a daily basis as a hook for students, which enabled them to work collaboratively on exercises and complete online assessments.\\n  PEDs including iPADs, mobile devices or laptops were restricted during instructional time unless the teacher had given permission for students to use them. Students were permitted to use their PEDs between classes, in the hallways or in the school cafeteria. While on cafeteria duty, I noticed students plugged into their mobile devices texting their friends, surfing the web, using social media or scanning through their photo galleries.\\n  This practicum commenced at the start of a new semester with an opening assembly for students. The school administration discussed the rules for PEDs in the school and warned students about the dangers associated with pictures and social media. Students were reminded that taking photos on their PEDs were completely forbidden in which severe consequences would be issued if necessary.\\n  This high school experience varied greatly from my previous elementary school placements such that technology integration was more prominent in the school. Despite the fact that the school is new and apart of an affluent community, a culture in the school existed in which students were readily using PEDs both inside and outside the classroom. The school environment was extremely supportive of technology integration and the resources were plentiful. This was a wonderful opportunity for me as teacher candidate to learn and explore technology integration and gain a better understanding of how technology creates meaningful and authentic learning experiences for all students. ,\\n8,1156,2,Animoto\\n  Free on iOS/Mac/Android\\n  A mobile/in-browser app that allows you to create 30-second videos.

She was admirably SMARTboard-savvy, and used it to great effect. I was expected to do the same, and she was very helpful in filling in my knowledge gaps. Nearly every Math and Language had an instructional component that featured models on the SMARTboard. Certain moments in particular impressed me; for example, for a culminating Language Arts task, students used mini whiteboards, in small groups, to brainstorm success criteria. When finished, the class culled the brainstorm to produce four or five criteria, first handwritten on the SMARTboard and then conveted into text so that they could be more easily read. This use of technology saved time and made things clearer. I’m confident that it definitely helped her to achieve her goals.\\nShe regularly updated the class’ EdMolo account with homework assignments and instructions. Even in February, students were still getting used to checking the site regularly and I took this as a sign that it might not be a fair expectation of them. But in general, it became a very handy way of disseminating information over the weekend. For example, because I wanted students to have the extra time, in the coming weekend, to rehearse some poetry, I posted the poems they could choose on Saturday morning. By Monday, many students had already memorized them. So I think EdModo’s efficacy in getting more work out of students is demonstrable; whether or not this is a good thing is up for debate!\\nStudents had access to Netbooks. The machines were a very necessary tool for our ‘neighborhood revitalization’ project, providing a good deal of information to students who could work independently.  As a compliment to the walks the students took around the neighbourhood to collect primary data ‘on the ground’, Google Maps gave students an overall picture of neighborhoods geographic, economic and architectural and infrastructural features. Twenty minutes of exploring the neighbourhood using the program could tell students more, and in a different way, than an hour of instruction or walking. I think the combination of web surfing and neighbourhood walking was vital in students producing such excellent final products and learning a lot.\\nI can see a few reasons why this class’ use of technology was so successful. First, the technology was always brought out for a clear purpose that couldn’t be achieved in the same way without it. Modeling the division of negative number using counters needs to happen if all students are going to be able to do it themselves, but counters are small and difficult to see. It’s much easier to use the SMARTboard application than to draw them on the board.\\nSecond, the teacher had very clear instructions around technology use and misuse. I know that she spent a lot of time early on in the year teaching students how to use technology effectively and appropriately. Students respected and made better use of their learning time because of this.,\\n8,1159,1,Name: WeSeed\\n  Price: Free\\n  Link: http://www.weseed.com/\\n\\nDescription: WeSeed is a stock market simulator.

The protractor and ruler are more unwieldy than their tangible counterparts, but the instant unit conversion is a useful feature.,\\n8,1161,7,  In my most recent practicum, at Branksome Hall\\'s Junior School, I worked with both my associate teacher in the Learning Strategies (LS) room and a Grade 5 classroom teacher (teaching math to her students). I was struck by the sheer amount of technology available for students: SMARTboards and document cameras in every classroom, iPads in the LS room loaded with educational apps, and laptop carts, which I hadn\\'t seen in any of my prior placements.\\n  The amount of technology did not necessarily lead to a more robust and enhanced use of it, however. For the most part, SMARTboards were simply glorified projector screens. While teachers used the document camera to model procedures, and displayed plenty of multimedia artifacts in the form of slide shows, video clips and diagrams, I didn\\'t see a great deal of day-to-day student interaction with the SMARTboards; they were largely used for information transmission, not interaction. However, when it came time for their class presentations on natural disasters, the Grade 5 students made slide shows using PowerPoint that were surprisingly elegant and information-dense. They weren\\'t needlessly flashy, as sometimes happens when children discover the Transitions section. This was a relief to me, as I sometimes suspect teachers employ the SMARTboard more for its wowing powers than its ability to actually enhance student learning. I believe it was more the Grade 5 teacher\\'s pedagogic style, rather than any specialized knowledge about PowerPoint, that was the main contributing factor leading to these presentations\\' concision and impact, but students certainly demonstrated a strong overall understanding of this particular form of digital technology and its uses.\\n  I observed Grade 4 and 5 students using laptops and desktops to conduct research (on animals and natural disasters, respectively). They were allowed to use only a few trusted online sources, combined with the books in their classroom and school libraries. While this doesn\\'t resemble the kinds of casual, bar-dispute-resolving research adults conduct on the Internet in their spare time (i.e. where Google isn\\'t off-limits), it does prepare students for a future in the academic world. I wondered for a while where the transition takes place, from teacher-approved websites to free and open research (Safe Search still on, of course) -- and then realized that such a switch would be highly dependent on teachers\\' (and parents\\' and administrators\\') theories of mind and human development, and thus different across multiple settings.\\n  Students did not seem to know the basics of searching (e.g. that common, non-lexical items such as \"the\" and \"of\" could be eliminated, or the existence of Boolean operators). This is something I will definitely teach as a means of fostering multiliteracies in my classroom.\\n  The only use of technology that I would classify as Type II (within this setting) is probably the least impressive. For all the recent fuss over cloud computing, we\\'ve already had it for a long time, and it\\'s called e-mail. At Branksome, I saw e-mail being used very effectively to communicate between teachers, from teacher to student (in combination with Blackboard) and from teacher to parent. It was through e-mail that parents found out whether the following day would be a snow day. It was through e-mail that the assistant principal was able to alert all classroom teachers about an unfortunate bathroom incident and implement a sign-out policy in response. It was through Blackboard that students checked to see what their homework was, or conducted pre-class research prep based on links curated by the teacher. The ease and efficiency of this near-instant communication cannot be taken for granted; I have seen other schools where it is not used nearly as effectively.\\n  My major new understanding, after this placement, is that it can take a while before new technologies are used to their maximum. In the meantime, however, pre-existing technologies can be clarified and refined until they are no longer seen as magical, instant life-changing devices, but tools with a distinct form and context. At Branksome Hall, such pre-existing technologies ended up being the ones that were most effectively used, in my opinion.,\\n8,1162,1,  During my practicum, I was placed in a school that was struggling to integrate technology into their classrooms. The school had no Smart Boards, nor any teachers who were exceptionally knowledgeable with technology (at least none that I came across during my conversations in the staff room). Each classroom had a standard set of technology pieces to use: 2-3 computers, projector, document camera, sometimes a scanner. Since it was a school located in the PDSB, there should have been a BYOD policy in effect, but personal devices were still banned from use in the classroom. The students still brought them to school, but were only allowed to use them at recess – and they did. There were only 21 students in my class and there were 7 students who had their own device. Clearly the students wanted to use their devices, but were prohibited from doing so. Another unfortunate shortcoming for the school was their Wi-Fi network. It was installed during my third week, but had not been turned on thereafter. I believe their plan is to use it starting next year. I believe this was a huge loss for the students.\\n  Fortunately, my AT was a little more forward thinking, when it comes to using technology, than the school as a whole. He often has the students working in the lab, at least 4 times a week. He has a few major assignments throughout the year that are made using technology. For example, he uses flip cams and windows movie maker to get the students to make stop motion animation videos. He also has students create and present digital posters as one of their summative tasks. My AT was very open-minded about using technology in the classroom, and he, himself, was very comfortable with various technologies. In fact, he was the one who other teachers turned to for their everyday tech-support needs. My AT also used a lot of technology on a day-to-day basis, not just for occasional assignments and projects. He used the document camera and a computer every day. He showed a lot of videos and often had students working on the classroom computer.\\n  Towards the end of the practicum, I began really analysing his use of technology and how appropriate it was. I wondered whether or not he used them to enrich his pedagogy, or simply as short cuts. For example, during a read aloud, the students suggested I use the document camera instead of circulating the room, like how the AT does it. Personally, I think circulating works better in read alouds for the sake of both classroom management and the experience itself.\\nTowards the end, I concluded that the way my AT used technology was sometimes good and sometimes bad. He incorporated both Type 1 and Type 2 uses of technologies into his program, and that’s how it should be. Sometimes, teachers need to present information to students, and using technology to boost the interest level is appropriate, as long as it doesn’t distract student learning. Furthermore, my AT was working within his means. He used every bit of existing technology as much as possible, and brought in his own pieces too, like cameras, iPod, and a stereo system. The socioeconomic restraints of the student body at the school was another restraint on his ability to use technology. Some students didn’t have internet access at home, so using web-based technologies was a challenge for them, which is why he had them work in the lab as often as he did.\\n  Overall, my experience with the AT was a good one. He was supportive of my attempts to integrate technology. He helped me make a consent letter for parents when I got the students to sign up for Edmodo, and he allowed me to do a workshop for the class on how to use Prezi. Integrating technology was important to him, and I saw him using it the best, and the most, he could. ,\\n8,1163,1,  I was located at Wedgewood Elementary, a K-5 school in TDSB in Etobicoke.  The technology use I observed was reflective of the age.  Cellphone use was prohibited except where carried for emergency use; few students flouted that rule or indicated huge interest in cellphones.  Most students indicated having access to computers at some point, but were not carrying around expensive smartphones. \\n  This was my fourth practicum overall and my third in the TDSB.  My two previous TDSB placements had almost no technology present in the school, and none at all in the classroom.  My YRDSB practicum offered significantly more options as there were resources both within and outside the class, and there were small notebooks which students could use for basic typing work and some basic app access.  This most recent practicum was the first, however, where I had access to a SMART board. Global access through notebooks versus interactive access via a SMART board have different strengths, and if forced to choose I would take global access for older students and the interactive access for the younger.\\n  Many people complain that SMART boards are often used as little more than a glorified whiteboard.  However, so much of the techniques involved in ‘good teaching’ (particularly with younger students) really boil down to managing the class in a way that carves out time for one on one interactions, that manages the flow in a way that students can move seamlessly between activities, and allows for multiple learning styles to access materials.  While in my first month of my use of the SMART board did not go beyond what a good overhead projector with pre-done transparencies could have done alongside a computer, it did allow for it to be done much faster, in one document, and easily referenced and filed.  As such, it did exactly what good pedagogy can do; save time in class for more conferencing time, ease transition times, and enable more media through which students could access the materials.  As such, even discrete uses of the SMART board were helpful despite the fact that I was not harnessing its full capabilities. It also allowed for quick and simple transition between typing and writing things out where appropriate (ie, in math) which computers usually make very difficult.  The “turnkey” solution for lesson planning was tremendously helpful from a teaching point of view, particularly with younger students.\\n  In addition to my own homeroom, I also observed the students in their French class which was not equipped with any technology. As a recent French learner who had the opportunity to access a phonetics lab, I see huge potential in computer use for both native and non-native language improvement.  Although I was impressed with the French teacher and the level the students managed to acquire, there was a definite missed opportunity to leverage technology.  The voice recording options available through a computer or smart phone are significant and could have increased the amount of oral interaction which occurred in the language class.\\n  Overall, this practicum was useful for observing a range of technology uptake and was extremely helpful for undergoing a learning curve with a SMART board and discovering the kind of teacher I can be when I have access to different tools. ,\\n8,1164,1,     The most striking aspect of the technology policies at Voice Intermediate School (VIS) is that they do not explicitly exist. Searching their website yields no evidence of any guidelines concerning the in-school use of technology, nor do students\\' agendas have any rules listed. This is not a problem, however; since VIS isn\\'t part of the TDSB, it doesn\\'t need to comply with its Online Code of Conduct, or any explicit guidelines concerning technology.\\n  E-mail correspondence with a VIS teacher gave me some additional information: \"VIS doesn\\'t have a written technology policy per se but we do have \\'rules\\' around it\" (quotations are the teacher\\'s, not mine). Those so-called \\'rules\\' are the following:\\n  Students\\' cellular phones are to be turned off and left in their lockers during the day\\nEach student is required to have a laptop and it is to be used for school purposes only (for notes, projects, etc.)\\n   A related fact:\\nThe school currently has three SMARTboards (in the Science, History and Math classrooms) and plans to equip every classroom with one\\n   I had a conversation with my would-be AT about the first guideline and he said that this was not only for the purposes of classroom management but because the brick walls made it difficult enough for teachers\\' wireless access to the Internet; with cellular phone interference it would be near-impossible. I did not see any students contravening the guideline, and I don\\'t think the absence of their phones made the students anxious or unable to interact with the material.\\n   As for the second rule, I originally felt this was not an inclusive policy, since it presumed that students were uniformly able to follow it. Though the cost of tuition at VIS may suggest that this is the case, I didn\\'t think that it captured the likely reality that there are hidden accessibility issues at play (e.g. students receiving financial aid). However, my AT assured me that students who could not afford laptops were provided with one. I\\'m not exactly sure of the logistics of this - whether such students kept them permanently or had them only during the course of the school year - but, whatever the case, it took care of the access issue during the school year.\\n   I saw two of the SMARTboards used in the Math and Science classrooms. In the Math class I witnessed, students were sorting products into the various sections of a Venn diagram, certainly extending their learning by being able to virtually manipulate the numbers (instead of having static representations in a textbook). In the Science class, I saw the SMARTboard being used for Google Maps, displaying a video, and for the teacher to scribe notes (to be printed for later use, as exemplars for student note-taking and explication of the scientific method), all of which expanded students\\' awareness of their world (the Google Map exploration helped with their mapping task, the video enriched their ecosystem unit and the note-taking was a good model of exemplary student behaviour).\\n   I think that, while the technology policy seemed at first to be too broad and casual, it respects junior and intermediate students\\' burgeoning independence, counting on them to be focused in their use of technology, and to avoid inappropriate behaviour without being told. I don\\'t know how feasible this would be in a larger school, or one with a weaker sense of community, but at VIS it seems to be working.,\\n8,1165,1,This was the bullying video that I was talking about on Monday\\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltun92DfnPY,\\n8,1166,1,,\\n8,1167,1,,\\n8,1168,2,  My last school had only 2 classes -  grade 7 and 8, with 64 students in total. 8 computers were scattered between the classes and were available for student use during lessons, but were mostly used by students to print assignments. During breaks students were allowed to use the computers for games and YouTube videos, as long as no other student needed to use them for school assignments. Teachers required students to print all their assignments – electronic submissions were not accepted. It was possible to book a cart with laptops for almost every student, but the cart needed to be booked in advance and shared with classes from another school. Due to the limited availability and the inability to plan for consistent use of the laptops, teachers did not plan activities which required students to use them during class. During my time there I have not seen the laptop cart in use. Teachers occasionally used computers for presentations, but projectors in the school were not always working and wireless internet was very inconsistent. As a result, most presentations were done using overheads.\\nI think the limited access to technology had a negative impact on student learning. At times teaching and learning became overly reliant on pen and paper, which was problematic for some students and boring for others. Students had already been using Google documents, so teachers could have provided feedback directly on the electronic document (via sharing) rather than requiring printing and providing han written comments. Presentations through overhead were not as interactive and not as clear as computer based presentations, and I generally found them more difficult to prepare.,\\n8,1169,2,By popular request, here are the slideshows for each cohort from the Graduate Celebration.

      "8,34,7,IMO learning about the abacus would be most fruitful for only one or two classes, after which you reach a point of \"diminishing returns\". The kids' fingerwork impressed me the first time, but I think it's not much different from how accountants or cashiers seem to have an extraordinary knack for mental math, or how a computer programmer/gamer's ability to touch-type is pretty much implicit memory--generally, if you spend enough time practicing any task, it becomes more innate. These kids are essentially practicing to use manipulatives just as some of us used base 10 blocks when I was in elementary school.\n",
      "  Yes, when I was in elementary school, base 10 blocks were only used to teach me what basic operations (+,-,x,/) mean. But once you knew their meanings, you'd move to calculating on paper (i.e. written notation) and later on, digital calculators, because it's more efficient to do so than to stack blocks. It seems like the abacus is the Japanese counterpart to paper and pencil and base 10 blocks. It's like a 2-in-1 teaching tool and calculator. Some westerners similarly have an easier time doing mental math when they pretend to write out the calculation on an imaginary paper with their index finger (though not to the proficiency of the kids in the video). Otherwise, the western equivalent to the abacus would be being able to manipulate blocks at record speed. Rather than spending the time to develop that muscle-memory and develop the necessary mental pattern-recognition system, kids who already understand basic operations should probably focus on practicing applying them to problem solving contexts.\n",
      "  On the other hand, though, I think the abacus would be great as an introduction to a lesson on algorithms, seeing it as a sort of \"analog calculator\". As well, it's a nice example of bringing culture into math. Another example would be the Lattice Method of multiplication (according to Wikipedia, it's of Persian origin), which is highly inefficient, but, in the rare instance that it's taught in a western classroom, nicely gives kids exposure to different ways of carrying out operations (and different algorithms).\n",

      "8,35,3,Mathematical fluency...I'm not sure about fluency in terms of understanding the language of math, but I think it's more a matter of repeatedly going through the finger motions and reinforcing its association with certain visual cues. With practice, the combined finger movements and visual cues becomes encoded in the brain as some meaningful, higher order construct (a pattern, essentially). A bit like--as addressed last class--how some students can memorize multiplication tables and recite multiplication statements, but still not understand what those statements/the concept of multiplication actually means. That's not to say that the Japanese students don't understand the math, but that it's possible to accurately learn the abacus algorithms and do operations without understanding what the abacus pieces mean.\n",
      "  I'm not sure about the neuroscience involved hereafter (this would be Wassim's expertise)(and with just about everything I feel like I have to look for reductionist explanations), but I feel that memory recall is more potent when you're acting something out instead of imagining it happen. Maybe they needed to move their fingers simply because abacus pieces don't move by themselves, and that adding finger movements makes the problem-solving setting feel more as if they had the actual abacus in hand. Somehow I'm still open to the possiblity that finger movements have nothing to do with the actual mathematical problem-solving process, but more as a pattern-recognition/recall aid or even a security blanket. As removed from pedagogy as that sounds, I think it's plausible assuming the students never had any exposure to other calculation tools.\n",

The math aspect isn't very apparent, since there are no numbers involved--finding patterns is how you'd be able to complete the game (rescuing all 625 zoombinis). This game isn't as childish as others during its time, it can get really challenging, the plot is pretty decent for an educational game, it has a high replay value, and the overall game design is really clever. A lot of the graphics/character interactions remind me of the nonsensical side stories you see in Where's Waldo books.\n",

      "8,51,1,As we begin our journey as teachers of the adolescent learner, we believe that creating a school environment that is culturally aware is not only possible, but necessary. In fact, the first step of teaching students to be culturally aware is for teachers themselves to be culturally aware! Respecting cultural diversity is not only a cornerstone in community-building, but also a way to make material relevant to students. Every student brings with them their own story, and as educators, it is our responsibility to learn about their stories, our students as individuals, and celebrate them. As a group, we concluded that the way we incorporate cultural diversity would vary depending on our class and school community. For example, a community that is predominantly African-American would have different needs and therefore, different learning mediums, than a community that is diverse. Here are some ideas:\n",
      "  • making material relevant to learners\n",
      "-         achieve this by considering students’ interests and cultural backgrounds\n",
      "-         e.g. History lesson: incorporate self-reflection questions, so as to connect course material to students’ cultural identities\n",
      "• bridging life at home with life at school through parental involvement\n",
      "-         e.g. parents writing letters to teachers about their kids or themselves\n",
      "• teacher should be aware of boundaries\n",
      "-         e.g. potential conflicts in dress code (religious attire and discomfort to students, which may further make them self-conscious about their culture)\n",
      "• teachers should be attentive to planning special events on cultural holidays, etc.\n",
      "• ESL students—electronic translators to communicate ideas,\n",
      "8,52,2,  Society has always labeled adolescents in a stereotypical way. This stereotypical view of adolescents, and developmental stages in general, is cultural construction that is defined by each time period. We tend to see adolescents in a negative light: experimental, driven by hormones, rebellious, sloppy, animal-like, in search of their own identity, unproductive, and lazy. Through our readings, we realized the need to view each adolescent on an individual basis, not defined solely by age or developmental stage. Each adolescent has his or her own life-experiences, previous knowledge and cultural identity. We should recognize individual interests and integrate them into our teaching to make our material more relevant and engaging.  Our vision of teaching now includes a responsibility to get to know and understand our students and utilize this in our teaching strategies. We also have come to see that relationships are an important part of the teaching process. Relationships between teacher and students build a student’s relationship with learning. It is also important for teachers to understand the student’s relationships with peers and their family, which frames students’ identity and further reinforces the notion that adolescents are different from one another. Further, we as teachers should be aware of students’ interests and encourage students to pursue their interests outside of school. We should attempt to bring those outside interests into the classroom and school. For example, a student who likes to blog on their spare time can perhaps write a blog that represents their classroom or school adding to the community and at the same time deepening their interests. It has become clear through our group’s discussion that the need to recognize adolescents as unique individuals is necessary to the learning process and that treating adolescents as a group hinders learning.,\n",

It was evident from the readings that research, and the resulting findings, can be applied to learning. For example, studies show that tying two subjects together will increase consolidation.  More specifically, simply teaching borders in geography will have a low level of retention. Teaching the reasons for the borders (even if not part of the government requirements) will highly increase retention, and thus retrieval of the information.,\n",

      "8,64,1,Drawing on examples from all of this weeks' readings, I think the most effective tool in generating a middle school program that values the adolescent learner is one that looks at each student individually rather than a program that relies on preconceptions about what an 'adolescent' learner encompasses or is capable of. One of the main themes that I picked up on from this weeks' readings was the importance of building individual relationships. In the case with Mac for instance, the 14 year old African American boy, the only reason he was able to express his point of view was because the teacher was genuinely interested in his perspective and understanding where he was coming from. A teacher who was less concerned with indivudal relationships may have written Mac off as an aggressive, misbehaving child and not taken the time to understand that he was reliable and trustworthy. A deeper look into Mac's experience at home and in his community at large made the teacher realize why Mac was behaving the way he was. This example compared with the student whose family recently immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic for example, is a demonstration of how getting to know your students can be very effective. In the case with the girl from the Dominican, her teacher did not take the time to understand her experiences at home and in the community which likely would have contributed to a very different understanding of what this student was capable of.,\n",

      "If introducing new material to younger students, I'd stay away from games or most things digital since the gameplay could be distracting from the math. Even if it weren't distracting, digital media is inherently more \"removed\" from the student than hands-on learning or arguably even teacher transmission. There's something about being able to manipulate base 10 blocks or plastic pizza slices with your own hands that enriches a student's understanding of, say, addition/subtraction of fractions. If you were to click and drag manipulatives or \"solve for x\" on a computer screen, there's a bit of a \"then a miracle occurs probably because that's what the programmers intended\" feeling; if you can compose music, read the news, or slingshot an angry bird at a pig with just a click of a mouse, then my guess is, psychologically, the \"reward\" of mouse-clicking your way to 3/4 + 1/2 of a pizza = 5/4 of a pizza is suppressed. There may even be no reward because the computer can't distinguish between haphazard clicking around by a bored student who happened to land the right answer and careful, thoughtful calculation by the determined student. In other words, the computer program can only verify final answers, but not validate the process (at least not that I'm aware of). But with real-life manipulatives, you know that the new shape or quantity that you formed by joining blocks/pizza slices together is a true instance of addition by virtue of your hands actually adding pieces together. The combined result--the actual sum--should feel bigger and heavier in your hands, and you can communicate your findings with your teacher.\n",

      "But as for drilling math (which I'm a huge believer in), and assuming you have a thorough enough understanding of the concept, I think games are great!

As well, you don't have much time to think or examine each expression since you have cannibalistic bad guys chasing you...kinda like Pac Man with math. I feel that Math Blaster was a lot more slow-paced and favoured plot and character development over math drilling. In fact, I'd probably argue that Math Blaster isn't a very good math practice tool because (even if it engages students with its space theme and adventure story) it just doesn't ask enough questions for students to actually attain mastery of the math, so the math becomes secondary to the game. In Number Munchers, math IS the game. You'd have to spend around 5 minutes jet-packing through a cave to solve 9 or 10 equations in MB, while you can solve the same equations in NM in 30 seconds. Again, assuming that the student is comfortable with the material, I think the time pressure of NM would be appreciated. Given the limitation that MB's gameplay is only as fast as its plot, I'm not even sure what its developers intended for their audience. Learning? Drilling? Just an appreciation for math?\n",

      "8,81,7,  None of the readings changed our thoughts about adolescence, per se; however, the readings made explicit and clarified our ideas about adolescents.  We recognize that most adolescents are developmentally fragile and on the threshold between childhood and adulthood; the Lesko and Nakkula articles linked these fragile moments to specific psychological theories (Recapitulation Theory and Erikson respectively).\n",
      "  This has made us realize that the teacher’s role in the adolescent classroom is more critical than ever.  During these years students are not only coping with hormonal, social, emotional, and possibly behavioural changes – they are also concretizing their identity; a developmental stage that will become the bedrock of their adult identity.  We as teachers need to recognize this and actively nurture this development.  If our classrooms promote caring relationships, high expectations, and inclusive participation, then we encourage students to think for themselves and become independent. (From the Bonnie Benard article)\n",
      "  It is also important to note that students may not necessarily be treated equally, but they must be treated equitably.  An English Language Learner (ELL) adolescent is likely to be undergoing the same challenges facing a native English speaker, and thus their identity development is equally as important to respect.  One way to do this may be to openly acknowledge their cultural background and find ways to incorporate their language into the classroom; this has the double-edged benefit of exposing other students to that culture and encouraging pride in themselves.,\n",
      "8,82,3,  One possibility that arose, having seen it attempted before, was the idea of a genuinely cross-curricular program.  The school year would be divided into terms or semesters each having their own them, perhaps based around a relevant current or school event (e.g. Earth Month, the Olympics, school musical/play) or a more abstract idea (e.g. What’s in Your Neighbourhood, Go the Next Mile).  Class content and assessments would then be linked to and surround these cross-curricular themes.  For example, a term surrounding the school musical could incorporate strands from the Arts and English, but depending on the subject matter may also include Languages (if a multi-lingual production), History/Geography, Phys. Ed, and others.  We wondered whether such a scenario might be more feasible in a public or private school – both must operate within a framework, but perhaps one setting is more suitable for a cross-curricular program than the other.\n",
      "  Another possibility, and one that is far more practical, is to incorporate multicultural elements into the classroom on a regular basis, either as part of a formal classroom content (e.g. open-ended assessments) or on an informal basis (e.g. World Holiday Calendar).  In the case of formal assessment it is important to remember to define the criteria and maintain a framework while still permitting student choice.  Also, there is difference between a classroom that is culturally responsive (i.e. one that promotes respect and awareness) and one that is culturally irresponsible (i.e. one that inadvertently promotes other extremes).  Constant questioning is imperative, and the process of sharing also goes the other way – students need to hear as well as be heard. ,\n",
      "8,83,4,Question 1:\n",
      "In reading Lesko, we identified one of the main points as being the negative aspects of considering middle students as being neither children nor adults; “they cannot go backward to childhood nor forward to adulthood”. The downfalls of this paradigm is that we dismiss learners in this stage and disvalue the worth of their thinking. By recognizing that this is a stage in itself, simply marked with an incredible increase in knowledge absorption and linking between these knowledge “islands” via critical thinking. With this latter mindset, it is easier to conceptualize critical thinking exercise and even more importantly fostering an environment where students are comfortable bringing ideas forward in a public forum to gauge thinking and thereby tweak the teaching to tailor it to individual students.  In addition, we believe there is great value in building relationships between the teacher and every individual student.  As this weeks’ readings highlight, a positive relationship between the teacher and the student allows for the use of personally meaningful and relevant information to be used as a teaching tool.\n",
      "One question that has arisen out of our discussion is how to work within in system, which is essentially standardized. This standardization is in many ways built upon generalizations about what adolescence is and has deep roots in the history of education in our society. Many of these roots, as Lesko points out, put adolescents in a box. In many ways this is opposite to a lot of the ways Lesko’s article is suggesting we approach teaching intermediate students.  We look forward to learning how to bridge these differences. It will be necessary to be aware of the kind of thinking that Lesko identifies as problematic as we read about, discuss, plan and engage in teaching.\n",
      "  Question 2:\n",
      "  Drawing on examples from this week's readings, we believe that the most effective tool in generating a middle school program that values the adolescent learner is one that looks at each student individually rather than a program that relies on preconceptions about what an 'adolescent' learner encompasses or is capable of. The reasoning for this is that who the student may be in the classroom may not reflect their identity in the community, where they came from, or the world in which they are being raised (these elements compromising the concept of culture).Part of 'knowing students' is being aware of and understanding their whole identity, not just what is superficially observed in class. Education is not one-size-fits-all. Each class is firmly located in a time and place, and its activities, atmosphere, values and set of social-relational codes that make it unique relative to all other classrooms. As teachers, we have to connect with the communities we work in to understand what makes them unique, what troubles them and how they fit into the larger fabric of their cities. Ladson-Billings message of \"inserting education into culture, instead of culture into education\" means that we need to be a part of that culture first, so that the 'inserting' makes sense, that it is organic, and that it is effective.\n",
      "One overarching theme in this week’s readings was accomplishing the above by building individual relationships. In the example of the student named Mac, the teacher cultivated a personal relationship with the student and was genuinely interested in his perspective and understanding where he was coming from. This enabled Mac to express his point of view. Had the teacher not bothered to establish these connections, Mac may have been written off as an aggressive, misbehaving child and time would not have been taken to understand that he was reliable and trustworthy.\n",
      "Having established that it is important to get to know students, we must address the ‘how’. As teachers we need to recognize the inherent uniqueness of each class and try to 'construct' a classroom environment that is conducive to all students’ needs and allows them to feel safe, important, and successful. This will allow students to feel more comfortable participating, asking questions, and will ultimately, in the ideal setting, perform beyond their potential. It is only when we have reached this state of openness that a dialogue can be established in which the teacher and student can get to know each other, engendering the type of relationship that allows for success.\n",
      "Once that the students are comfortable in class and the dialogue has been established, teachers can use many techniques to optimize relationships with students including\"speaking to the parents, conducting home visits, and asking students during an activity what their hopes and dreams are for the future\".\n",
      "Having explained why it is essential to create a positive environment and get to know one’s students, let us briefly consider two examples.\n",
      "Toronto has a high number of immigrants which may be concentrated in certain areas. This results in schools that may be practically homogeneous in their ethnic makeup. Knowing personal information about students and not just the stereotypes can help you, as a teacher, teach a lesson on immigration based on the student's own experiences: what drives people to move away from their native land, how the immigration process was conducted, how it is living in Canada and learning English. Something abstract to the students, such as immigration to Canada made by early Europeans, may not necessarily be as engaging or as relevant as it could be if it was applied to the experiences of the students and their families.  This constructivist approach could help answer some of the questions about where the students fit in the world and could also act as a bridge between the school and home (making it relevant).\n",
      "In the example of the student that immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic, we see that getting to know one’s students can be very effective. In her case, the teacher did not take the time to understand her experiences at home and in the community. Had this been done, she would not have been simply labelled as a poor speaker of English (and thus a ‘poor student’), but as an industrious individual who speaks a foreign language fluently and has good street smarts. This would have made her instruction more personal and she would have felt more invested in her own education (and likely more encouraged as well).,\n",
      "8,84,1,To add on to Tanya's response, I think that getting to know the individual first (sociocultural status) by perhaps \"speaking to the parents, conducting home visits, and asking students during an activity what their hopes and dreams are for the future\" is crucial in knowing how to conduct your class and form the lessons.  For example, there may be a large student base in your class from Korea.  Knowing personal information (not only the stereotypes) can help you as a teacher teach a lesson on immigration based on the student's own experiences: what drives people to move away from their native land, how the immigration process was conducted, how it is living in Canada and learning English. Something abstract to the students as immigration to Canada made by early Europeans may not necessarily be as engaging or as relevant as it could be if it was applied to the experiences of the students' and their families.  This constructivist approach could help answer some of the questions about where the students fit in the world and could also act as a bridge between the school and home.\n",
      "  In terms of reaching out beyond the basic curriculum, integrating programs and activities (mentoring, sports, music, or in Mac's case \"Inventing the Future\") which requires a deep investment on the child's part build upon who they are as individuals.  This enables the teacher to actively participate in where they are going, and who they are becoming.  These activities not only offer attainment of skills and career paths choices, but the ability to build relationships, and see who they are through those relationships.  When these kids are pushed to the limits, like in sports for example, their best will come through, as well as their worst, but this is vital in order to help them find out who they are as individuals.,\n",

      "8,87,2,  Question One\n",
      "  We are consistent with the article’s belief that we view adolescence as a stage of ‘becoming.’ This view was partially shaped by the reality that it is a physical developmental stage.  Additionally, we agree with the assertion that adolescents lack a ‘voice’ in our society.  This act of ‘becoming’ is partially compounded by the fact that Canada lacks a clear transition or ‘rite of passage’ during which one transitions from ‘becoming’ to ‘being’.\n",
      "  In general, reading these articles impacted our views.  While we did not all resonate with the idea of the ‘primitive’ child, there were aspects of the articles that uncovered some of our underlying assumptions.  As outlined above, the belief in the act of ‘becoming’ was challenging and forced us to consider what exactly we believe ‘becoming’ means and whether that is a valid assumption.  Overall, we have reconsidered, but not rejected all of our assumptions.\n",
      "  We agree that the past strongly influences our present treatment and teaching of adolescences. Of particular note was the following excerpt:\n",
      "  ‘Colonialist conceptions of adolescence are embodied in policies which support and confirm the dependency of youth and the essential and permanent difference from adults encoded in age.’\n",
      "  We will be intentional in our attempt to understand the context of our students’ ‘culture,’ recognizing that it is not the same as ours, and even not necessarily the same as each others.  It is worth noting that we still all believe that it is a stage of development, but it does not define their entire being.\n",
      "  We will question whether students in our class have a true voice, and when we believe they are not being expressed, what we can do to facilitate those voices.  In our conversations, we were able to explore some of these strategies that we have been learning which could be applied to that goal.\n",
      "  Question Two\n",
      "  These articles gave us many ideas and conceptions of various culturally responsive middle school programs. At the heart of many of these strategies is developing caring and supportive relationships. Research revealed that a caring relationship with a teacher gave youth the motivation to succeed. A quality of a caring teacher is being socio-culturally conscious. This involves respecting views about diversity, encouraging student autonomy, learning about your students lives, their family make up, favorite activities and their concerns and strengths. One idea that we got from these articles was to have guest speakers from your student’s family and neighbourhood. This allows you to learn more about your students and demonstrates to them that you value their cultural heritage.\n",
      "  Using appropriate instructional strategies was another idea we felt was necessary to implement in the classroom. This includes, providing background information in your student’s first language, encouraging the use of bilingual dictionaries and using simplified language during lessons.\n",
      "  Students have shown to have higher levels of success and lower rates of problem behavior when they know that their teacher has high expectations of them. A natural outcome of a school that places high expectations on their students is participation. Meaningful involvement according to Benard is a fundamental human need. Schools that incorporate these opportunities are setting up their students to thrive academically and socially. ,\n",
      "8,88,1,  Question One:\n",
      "  Our preconceived notions of adolescence include: raging hormone, need friendly yet firm attitude and clear boundaries, rebels, a state of limbo, need to become young independent adults, time of a process of coming into your own.\n",
      "  After having read Lesko and others we realize that many of these notions are based on dubious science and racist origins. In shaping a future view of adolescence we feel that we cannot generalize adolescents any more than we can generalize adults. As teachers we need to talk to our students, listen to them and get to know them. They are people, not an age group.\n",
      "  Question Two:\n",
      "  In order to recognize what is relevant to your students we need to know them, their culture, perspectives and interests. There is more than one “right approach” to making information relevant to the students, and ultimately we would have to know them to know what works. For example, we could centre learning around projects that the students would collaboratively work towards. These projects would involve creating something that the students can relate to. An example for such a project would be for the class to write and act a play. The topic of the play would depend on the background and interests of the class. Through such activity the students will examine what makes a good play, the various elements of various plays, read and compare other plays and decide what qualities make them exceptional or not. Learning as means to work towards a certain goal is more engaging than simply receiving information to do well on the test. Also, having the class work on a comprehensive project enables the demonstration of multiple intelligences and modalities.\n",
      "   ,\n",
      "8,89,1,Part of 'knowing students' is knowing about and understand the place they live. Education is not one-size-fits-all. Each class is firmly located in a time and place, and its activities, atmosphere, values and set of social-relational codes must reflect that location. As teachers, we have to connect with the communities we work in, to understand what makes them unique, what troubles them and how they fit into the larger fabric of their cities. Ladson-Billings message of \"inserting education into culture, instead of culture into education\" means that we need to be a part of that culture first, so that the 'inserting' makes sense, that it's organic, and that it is effective.,\n",

      "8,91,1,  Question 1\n",
      "  As educators we are often faced with the realities of a situation, and in the case of adolescents, in failing to re-imagine the adolescent life stage from transitional to something that inherently \"is” we run the risk of not only failing to educate and encourage growth, but also risk alienation and marginalization.  We need to be aware that developmental psychological stages do exist, but also remember that adolescents are still people and individuals in time, even if their own identity is in flux.\n",
      "  In regards to a vision of teaching, we need to carefully examine our own pre-conceptions about adolescents in the classroom and bridge and integrate our previous knowledge with what we observe.  This stresses the importance of a personal connection with the students, beyond the classroom and also as a member of a community, acknowledging that there is more to a student then what appears in the classroom. For example, Mac from the Nakkula reading was better understood once his background was explored.\n",
      "  Furthermore as teachers, we must understand that adolescents - much like other non-dominant culture groups, ethnic groups or gender identities – deserve to be empowered and treated equitably.  Teachers must also continue to encourage academic excellence by setting high expectations and by creating opportunities for students to achieve these goals.  Some of the ways in which teachers can do this, can include: meaningful discussions, thought-provoking questions, and hands-on work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, though we have these views, most of society still sees adolescents as living “in transition” and write off adolescent experiences.\n",
      "  Question 2\n",
      "A culturally responsive middle school program values the adolescent learner's life experience, despite society's tendency to trivialize it or deem it simply 'transitional.' Teachers in such a program are interested in their students' lives, and actively engage them by implementing culturally-relevant curricula, or reworking existing curricula to be more inclusive. One way to do this, Villegas suggests, is by incorporating historically ignored perspectives into a lesson formerly based on the dominant culture's experiences. Students are also empowered by being able to share the practices and traditions of their own home lives in a safe, welcoming environment that explicitly recognizes a diversity of viewpoints as being beneficial to all.\n",
      "  A diverse curriculum is emotionally and cognitively useful to the mind of the adolescent learner, preventing foreclosure by ensuring that students see the variety of options possible for their future. Thus, the ideal curriculum uses classroom materials – such as novels – that provide a varied set of types of characters to serve as developmental examples to the student.\n",
      "Teachers must serve as advocates for their students, drawing on native language resources and building on students' interests outside school. In this way we demonstrate the importance of diverse experiences, raise expectations for students from low-status groups, and help to make schools more equitable for everyone.\n",
      "  In addition to bringing students' cultures into the classroom, we must take care to unpack the cultural norms presented in school texts (eg. blowing out the candles on a birthday cake, or living in a house with a patio and backyard) to ensure that every student accesses the curriculum from an equal footing.\n",

      "8,92,1,http://mtliteracy2011.wikispaces.com/Welcome,\n",
      "8,93,12,Our group first examined the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) Foundations for Professional Practice, which outlines expectations for Ontario public school teachers and comprises of the Ethical Standards, Standards for Professional Practice, and the Professional Framework (for professional development). Surprisingly, it was short and generalized--only two pages, and a far cry from the likes of the far more specific Illinois Professional Teaching Standards.\n",
      "  We found the OCT Ethical and Professional Standards to be mostly common sense, though we understand the OCT’s need, as a semi-political body, for explicit and public expression of these standards. Nonetheless, we are concerned that the standards are neither enforced nor regulated, and that after the initial two-year probationary period, teachers are only assessed internally by the principal.\n",
      "  Some school boards have mandated professional development sessions to ensure teachers' ongoing professional learning. One may argue that this is enough. For example, Anchor Charts are an increasingly predominant teaching strategy in TDSB schools, as learned in our CTL 7007 Authentic Assessment class.  However, the sheer human nature of some teachers makes it difficult to sustain and rekindle the initial spark of creativity, energy, and open-mindedness in the face of immense societal changes.\n",
      "  We continued to investigate some UK and US teaching standards. Most American states require examinations to complete teacher certification. On one hand, this ensures conformity and convergence--at least initially--to prescribed standards in practices and pedagogical content knowledge. On the other hand, standardized testing may be too rigid to accurately assess classroom management and teaching strategies, let alone course content.\n",
      "  The United Kingdom takes this one step further.  The national Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) continually evaluates teachers based on their attributes, knowledge, and skills. Three of the five performance statuses actually influence pay increases.  But would teachers neglect their classes in the effort to attain a higher level status? Anagnostopoulos et al. (2010) examined an American non-profit organization similar to the TDA and questioned whether the motivation for teachers seeking certification was “Dollars, Distinction or Duty”. They noted that opportunities for such teachers to take leadership roles and carry out initiatives in their schools varied too greatly to simply assume that certification begets improved teaching practice.\n",
      "  Yet such leveled evaluations and assessments may actually motivate teachers to improve their teaching practice, or at least remain vigilant. After all, just as students should attempt to earn better marks by working harder or being more creative, if teachers had to answer to an external organization it may be a formative incentive to improve their teaching practice.\n",
      "  Indeed, Beck, Hart & Kosnik (2002) concluded that although their surveyed sample of teachers already conformed to the tested teaching standards, there was always room for improvement, and teaching standards may be the very catalyst for better teaching practices all round.\n",

      "8,96,8,The Shift in my Development: A Changed Me\n",
      "        In thinking about when I experienced a shift in my own development, the first words that came to my mind were nursing school. After having completed my Honours Bachelor of Science (Life Sciences), I decided that entering an accelerated nursing program was the next best step for me. Looking back, I did not realize the impact that decision could potentially make on my life, nor did I ever believe that two years of a nursing education would change my life forever. Since I was a young girl, it was in my nature to take care of and worry about people, listening to their needs, and always trying to do my best in helping them. Believing that a good nurse carried these qualities, I was excited to begin the program, and nervous for a new start all at the same time.\n",
      "       The journey through nursing school at McMaster University is where I experienced major shifts in my development, cognitively, socially, emotionally, and morally. During my undergraduate education as a science student, I was accustomed to going to class in large lecture halls, listening to lectures amongst hundreds of other peers, and scribbling down never-ending notes. I figured that I tackled science, now let me tackle nursing – I would be fine!\n",
      "       The first month was probably the biggest challenge in terms of adjustment. My peers and I understood quickly that the expected learning style was much different than any of us had experienced before. Learning took place in very small groups and was centered around the problem-based learning (PBL) approach, “...in which the learner is presented with a clinical situation or client story as a starting point for the identification of learning needs...the preferred method of facilitating knowledge acquisition” (McMaster University Undergraduate Nursing Program, 2007, 7). Class after class, I sat in small groups, talking out clinical problems, basing my words on prior research I had done the nights before. The process was, at times, mentally draining. I was essentially attempting to fulfil the second core learning principle in How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice, which states, “to develop competence in an area of inquiry, students must have opportunities to learn with understanding. Deep understanding of subject matter transforms factual information into usable knowledge” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000, 12). My depth of preparation affected my ability to participate in discussions and impacted the degree to which my peers learned. I did not want to let anyone down, and I especially did not want to miss out on my own learning, so I read continuously, jotted down ideas, and always went to class reading to participate. I ended up excelling at PBL. The way I was acquiring knowledge and learning was like never before! I was now a more active and participative learner, more curious and pensive than ever before. I had no choice but to learn the PBL approach, accept it, and practice it, for it was the basis of my hands-on practical work during my clinical rotations.\n",
      "       During my clinical rotations I witnessed and experienced events that I never knew even existed – I saw life, death, and everything in between. I worked what seemed to be hundreds of 12-hour shifts, day and night. I was working with and learning from nurse preceptors, some positive and amazing, others dismissive, stressed, and horrible teachers. I worked with patients whom I cried and laughed with, and others who did not even open their eyes. I was journeying on an emotional rollercoaster, growing with maturity, with honesty, and most importantly, with courage (courage for me to continue and courage that I needed to instil in my patients when their days were darker than a black hole). I considered myself strong and I learned quickly that life was precious. Looking back today, I recall coming home after a long and tiring shift, not wanting to talk to my family and friends about my day. It would take me a couple days to unwind, mentally, before I could give them a glimpse of my nursing experiences. As a nurse, I learned quickly that critical self-reflection is what kept my feet on the ground. I submitted hundreds of self-reflections during nursing school. In these reflections, I would express my thoughts and emotions, my learning, and also my experiences. I was able to talk to myself, talk myself through my own experiences, and I was able to ask myself questions and then answer them at the same time. I was essentially practising metacognition which, “...often takes the form of an internal conversation...” (14), and this practice assists in creating transferable knowledge (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000). These reflections were very personal, exactly like a diary, and I experienced my shift in development twice over, in real-time and then on paper.\n",
      "       I had incredible professors who continuously supported me through my nursing education and reflective practises. The supportive and tight-knit small group atmosphere supported my learning and my development into a nurse and more importantly, into a person who was thinking, seeing, feeling, and understanding much more than she had ever done before!\n",

      "8,99,8,  I experienced a shift in my approach to conflict resolution 10 years ago, at the beginning of my relationship with Guy, my partner.  I grew up in a family that literally enjoyed fighting. We tended to be as quick in raising our voices as we were in making peace and calming down. Often it was just a form of loud venting. Guy, on the other hand,  did not like fighting and would almost never raise his voice. When we first had disagreements I tended to raise my voice. Guy just remained calm and simply asserted that there was no need to shout. It was very strange to me and even made me angry – I could not enjoy the fight without a fighting partner. I realized that for the sake of our relationship I would have to learn to resolve conflicts differently.\n",
      "  That realization alone did not help me remedy the situation immediately. I read some books about conflict resolution and started gradually applying new techniques I read about. It felt very awkward and unnatural at first, but Guy was very positive supportive. He used a lot humour to maneuverer out of confrontational situations and into working together towards a common goal. Eventually I grew more comfortable with my new repertoire of behaviours and even started applying them with my family.\n",
      "  My transition can be explained in terms or operant conditioning. My tendency to fight to resolve conflicts was conditioned during childhood through positive reinforcement - It worked well within my family. As cited in Seifert (2011) operant conditioning can lead to intrinsic motivation, which can explain why I tended to enjoy fighting. I generalized my behaviour by fighting not only with my family – I tried the same behaviour with Guy. Guy`s responses were not as reinforcing as my families and gradually I went through a process of discrimination and extinction. Guy’s continual positive reinforcement helped shaping my new behaviour.\n",
      "My shift of thinking can also be explained in constructivist terms, as cited in Seifert (2011). I experienced a process of accommodation, revising my pre-existing concepts of how conflicts should be resolved. I also received instructional scaffolding from “experts” – Guy’s modeling of an alternative behaviour.\n",
      "  Donovan et al. (1999, p. 10) mention the importance of engaging student’s preconceptions as a necessary prerequisite to learning. I can definitely relate to that. I was taught (but did not learn!) some conflict resolution techniques prior to meeting Guy, as part of some work training. Since the training did not elicit and challenge my preconceived notions of the best way to resolve a conflict, it had no real impact on my core beliefs and mental habits. In contrast, when I lived with Guy, I had the opportunity to experience the ineffectiveness and the negative consequences of my preconceived notions.\n",
      "  Nowadays Guy and I rarely have fights. We occasionally have arguments, but most often we just have conversations, after which we often agree and sometimes agree to disagree.\n",

      "8,100,1,            After readings the module “The Learning Process,” I realized that I could relate to the topic of respondent conditioning. There are many times when the changes in my development were positive, but as suggested by Kevin Seifert (2008) “…less positive examples of respondent conditioning can happen as well” (Module 2). I think this is important to understand before beginning to teach in a classroom.\n",
      "            When I was a child, I experienced a shift in emotional development while taking piano lessons. Instead of helping me to develop further and become more confident, this emotional shift due to respondent conditioning made me lose confidence and hate the piano.\n",
      "            When I was eight years old, I began to take lessons at Arcadia Academy of Music. I enjoyed the lessons, and I loved listening to the instrument. I would practice on my keyboard at home, and I played at all of the recitals. Every week, I looked forward to the next lesson. My teachers were positive and enthusiastic, and they were always very friendly.\n",
      "            When I was ten years old, my parents bought a piano for our house. It was an auburn baby-grand piano that sat in the living room, and when I played it I could see out the window into the front yard. The piano bench opened up, and I could keep my books inside. I loved to sit on the bench and practice. Soon after we bought the piano, I changed schools and signed up with the Royal Conservatory of Music. Instead of taking lessons in a classroom, a teacher would come over to my house and teach me at home. On the first day of lessons, the teacher rang the doorbell and entered my living room. She gave me new books and we began to play. With each passing lesson, she became meaner and meaner. When I would make a mistake, she would bang her fist on the piano and then put her head in her hands and sigh very loudly. If my hands were not in the correct position, she would grab them and poke my palms very hard with her fingers and scream “Apple in the hand!” so I would remember the correct way to hold my hands (as if I were holding an apple). If she knew that I was scared or upset, she would say, “Are you going to cry? Let me see.”\n",
      "            Whenever I had piano lessons, I began to feel sick. I would get headaches and become nauseated. Eventually, even when I practiced at home by myself, I would feel the same way. Whenever I sat at the auburn baby-grand piano, the feeling would come back. One year later, I switched back to Arcadia Academy of Music and began taking lessons there again. Although the teachers were much friendlier, I would feel sick every lesson.  I had associated the piano with the feeling of being nauseous and the bad teacher. Shortly after, I quit playing the piano.\n",
      "            Kevin Seifert  (2008) suggests that respondent conditioning describes changes in response to stimuli (Module 2). In this case, the Royal Conservatory teacher was the unconditioned stimulus. Whenever she banged on the piano, or yelled, it triggered an unconditional response and I would feel sick. Eventually, the piano became the conditioned stimulus, and whenever I sat at a piano I would have the conditioned response of getting nauseous. This response became generalized, and I would feel the same way while playing any piano with any teacher. During my lessons with the teacher from the Royal Conservatory of Music, I “learned” to hate and fear the piano. ‘\n",
      "            In How People Learn, Donnovan et al (2000) explains that children will come to the classroom with preconceived thoughts about a subject (p. 10). They will also, however, come with preconceived feelings surrounding different subjects or situations.  I think that it is not only important to understand their preconceived thoughts and try to deter any misconceptions, but we also must recognize their emotions, and try to make positive adjustments if necessary.\n",

      "  I asked my closest friends to describe me in three words – ‘loyal’, ‘generous’, and ‘kind’ were common adjectives in their responses. I see myself as a loving individual and one of my greatest joys comes from interacting with and getting to know people. I try to bring a positive attitude to any situation in life and always make an effort to pass kindness onto others. Being open to people has been a cornerstone of my personality for a long time. However, there was a period in my life, particularly during my youth, that these qualities were not prominent.\n",
      "  I began my grade 4 year at a new school, Claude Watson School for the Arts. I remember feeling anxious, nervous, and excited for my first day and was eager to make new friends. The summer preceding the start of the new school year was a difficult time for me, as I had many close friends from the school that I was leaving and was sad to part ways with them. I had also spent the last few weeks of the summer at a sleep away camp – my first time being a camper and away from home. The time that I spent at this camp was not enjoyable. For the first time in my life, I found it difficult to make friends and couldn’t connect with anyone. The other campers in my cabin singled me out and teased me for being a high achiever in my swim class. I remember developing a thick skin and a quick tongue and these carried with me into the school year.\n",
      "  The first months of grade 4 flew by and I got to know the students in my class very well. Thankfully, I got along with mostly everyone and made a few close friends. However, there was this one boy, Adam, that really got under my skin. He was always seeking attention, disruptive during class, obnoxious at recess, and annoying at lunchtime. Early in the year, we had been paired to work on an assignment together in class and we couldn’t agree on anything. We weren’t able to focus, didn’t complete the assignment, and as a result, received a horrible grade. I remember that as the year progressed, I teased him behind his back, excluded him at lunch, and even accused him of peeing his pants when he spilt Orange Crush on himself. My dislike for him peaked during one recess in the wintertime and concluded with me yelling, “You couldn’t even hurt a fly!” and pushing him down the playground slide. My actions got me into a lot of trouble and I was forced to speak with my teacher, the principal, Adam, Adam’s mother, and my mother in a meeting after school. I remember this meeting vividly; I cried so much. Adam also cried and confessed that he just wanted to be friends with me and that I had been so awful to him. I had no idea that I had hurt him that deeply and remember feeling guilty, sick to my stomach, and ashamed.\n",
      "  This incident has always stuck with me because I see it as a defining moment in my character and my life. I realized that I had become the very reason that I was so sad during my time at camp and that I never again wanted to be the cause for another person’s sadness. I learned that my actions have consequences and that everyone deserves respect and understanding. The reason I recalled this story for the brief paper is because I believe that the student dynamic plays a critical role in teaching (Kosnik and Beck, 2011). I strongly believe that the cornerstone of my teaching philosophy is community; an environment in which students feel safe, welcomed, and respected must absolutely be established before any learning can happen (Kosnik and Beck, 2011). Reflecting on my experiences with Adam, I can only imagine how difficult it must’ve been for him to pay attention to our teacher after returning from a lunch period that involved 10 other students laughing at him for “peeing his pants”. Comparatively, I remember how difficult it was for me to pay attention in class with someone like Adam always seeking attention and disturbing me. It is the responsibility of the teacher to set the tone for the classroom, ensure that all students are respectful of one another, and make sure that student relationships are healthy and constructive. I know that this will always be a priority for me in my future teaching practices.\n",
      "  On a side note, since that meeting with the school staff and our parents in grade 4, Adam and I have been best friends, racking up over 16 years of solid friendship. We currently live together in an apartment near Bloor and Ossington with another one of our friends. Adam enjoys film, soccer, and is one of the best guys I know. He still denies ever peeing his pants in grade 4, rightfully so, even though I still bring it up from time to time. Adam loves to drink Orange Crush and still sometimes spills on his pants.\n",

      "8,104,3,  During my first year of university, I underwent many changes. I experienced social and cognitive shifts in my development. Socially, university was very different from high school. I was no longer living at home with my family in Toronto. Instead attending the University of Western Ontario, I lived in a communal residence in London with 3 roommates. I met many new people in my residence, class and on campus that I befriended and my core group of friends changed dramatically as it was difficult to keep in touch with some of my high school friends that lived in other cities. I was forced to become more independent. I was responsible for my own day-to-day living including preparing meals, cleaning my own residence apartment, grocery shopping, transportation to class, completing homework etc. I embraced this independence and I was excited to be living on my own. I believe the social shift I experienced, moving away from home for university helped shape who I am today.\n",
      "  I also experienced a cognitive shift in my first year of university. I was now responsible for my own learning. My classes were made up of 700+ students with one professor who did not take attendance, tell me when to do my homework or when to study for exams. This differed so much from elementary and high school where my teachers and parents were so involved in my learning. In these large classes I did not feel that I was part of a community. Further, my professors did not address students’ pre-conceived notions. In How People Learn, Donnovan et al (2000) explain that students come to the classroom with preconceived thoughts about how the world works and that it is essential to engage these notions or else they will revert back to them when learning new and conflicting material. This same concept was reinforced the Harvard-Smithsonian video A Private Universe (1987) when Heather would not let go of her preconceived ideas about the phases of the moon. My professors did not address our preconceived notions nor use them to enhance their teaching. They simply lectured the pre-selected course material without time to slow down to take questions or evaluate what students were thinking about the material. Donnovan et al (2000) explain that students must have opportunities to learn with understanding. This deep understanding allows factual knowledge to become usable information. This was not part of my experience in my first year of university. The professor just relayed material for us to regurgitate on multiple-choice exams. Any information I learned was memorized and then forgotten after the exam, which meant it was not transferable across domains. There was no room for metacognition, as I was not thinking about what I was learning, I was just memorizing. There was also no room for professors to evaluate my thinking process, as all assessments were summative and counted for a huge portion of my mark. Professors also did not address diverse student needs. Lecture-style classes and multiple-choice evaluations do not account for different learning styles. After first year, I realized that I needed smaller classes with room for discussion and questions as well as varied forms of evaluations. I transferred to a program that accommodated my learning needs. The shifts I experienced in first year university were a product of my new living environment and learning environment. This was a great period of transition in my life.\n",

      "8,105,1,  In grade eleven I noticed that I was changing; but this was not a positive one. Slowly I began removing myself from social settings; not physically, but emotionally. This change was shocking to my friends, my family and to me because I had always been the most outgoing, vivacious, happy young girl. But I was changing. I never was able to pin point exactly what triggered this change, this slow decline into a depression so lonely and complicated. It did not last very long, this depression spurt I mean, as I found myself happy again when I entered university. I had never taken pills for being “mentally unstable”, nor had I seen a therapist to talk me through my seemingly long and lonely second last year of high school. Strangely, and fortunately, I was fine.\n",
      "The heavy wave of depression had passed and I entered university the same bubbly girl everyone knew me to be. I do not think I truly regained all my character that I had lost in high school, but for whatever it was worth I was closer to being methan I had been in a long time, and so I just went with it.\n",
      "After a couple of great years at the university of western Ontario, things made a turn for the worst. It was back. I was gone and my dark depression had swooped back in and consumed me, taking my place. Four year had gone by since the last time I was so empty. This time it was different. This time it was more consuming than ever before. Tactics I had used in high school to rid my mind of awful thoughts no longer worked for me as a university student. My friends did not get it. My schoolwork was compromised, my body was compromised and my mind was wholly compromised as well. For whatever reason, I couldn’t manage to find tactics that worked for me; to distract myself from my thoughts. Sometimes I felt so empty it was as though I had no thoughts at all. I was bare. I was no longer myself in anyway. Thing that usually made me happy made me feel nothing. Things that made me sad simply couldn’t compare to sadness I was experiencing. I was nowhere to be found.\n",
      "Skip forward a couple years, and I was back. No, I am back. I can thankfully say that I managed to tackle my depression and rid myself of it. I saw psychiatrists, I took some anti-depressants, and most importantly I learned to refocus my thought and take control over my metacognitive state. In my mind, I was able to define my goals and the means by which I hoped to achieve them. I trained my mind to be more positive, to recognize that sadness is only relative; sadness is only a mixture of thoughts with a bad spin. Put a good spin on then, however, and you can turn some of that around.\n",
      "I can honestly say that the person I am today is a mixture of the young girl I was before I first plunged into depressing, along with new insights, new optimism for life, and new metacognitive strategies that I take with me everyday, everywhere I go.\n",
      "In the article How People Learn, one thing stuck out to me as I was reading it, which trigged me into talking about this shift in my own development. That is, how certain metacognitive approaches ought to and can be integrated into the classroom in order to encourage students to take control of their own learning and of the strategies that work for them. I was able to adopt certain metacognitive strategies of my own that managed to control my thoughts, my way of thinking, and the positive spin I wished to take to influence my thoughts.\n",
      "Students need to be encouraged to develop their metacognitive thinking skills because frankly, even if it is of no use to them in the classroom, hopefully like me, they will find use for it elsewhere.\n",

      "  In the summer of 2011, I participated in an internship in Namibia through New College at the University of Toronto. For three months, I lived in a small town in Northern rural Namibia with three other female students from U of T. We lived alone for the majority of our stay there and arranged volunteer opportunities, social activities, and recreational travelling on our own. Before having gone on this trip, I had always lived in Toronto and was comfortable and settled in my community; I found no need to engage in activities for the purpose of building new relationships and felt no drive to shed my identity as an introvert. I was so attached to this role that I maintained it throughout my developing years and young adulthood, remaining shy and hesitant to embrace new experiences and relationships, completely wedded to the static, quiet life that I had created.\n",
      "  Needless to say, I was terrified at the prospect of leaving Toronto to live in Namibia. Namibia was a completely novel living situation where I would be unfamiliar with the culture, physical surroundings, language and people. I knew that by accepting the internship offer I would be putting myself in a socially uncomfortable situation. However, in learning to adapt to my new surroundings, I underwent a pronounced transformation from introvert to extrovert. I made a conscious decision while in Namibia to set aside the person that I was in the past, and learned to be someone that capitalized on opportunities, took initiative, disregarded one’s social fears, and was generally extroverted. My shift in thinking was supported very much by my external situation as an alien in a new environment: I knew that I had to be more outgoing and social during my short visit in Namibia in order to have a full range of experiences there. In that way, my circumstances and environment drove me to learn to change my attitude and persona, creating a drastically different experience for me in the way that I was perceived by my peers and interacted with my peers in my environment.\n",
      "  According to Educational Psychology, this development in my social personality was a behavioural shift in my learning: operant conditioning to the positive consequences of my new social effort (as cited in Seifert, 2011). For example, I went to social events and was immediately “rewarded” with the outcome of positive social interactions with my peers. I then continued to exhibit the behaviour of being social to continue to receive this “reward”. My learned behaviour became more strongly associated with the positive consequences as repeated social efforts on my part resulted in stronger friendships and relationships – the “reward” became bigger, thus propelling forward my desire to be more social.\n",
      "  This experience provides two insights that pertain to my future life as a teacher. Firstly, this experience clearly shows operant conditioning as explained above. This is a theory that can be used in the classroom to assist students in creating positive associations with learning in the classroom. Secondly, is the shift in personality that I underwent. We spoke briefly in our assessment course about how teachers each have a “persona” that they take on in the classroom. The process that I will have to undergo to discover and adopt this persona will be similar to the social transition that took place over the summer in that I will have to set aside some parts of my personality in order to become a teacher in the classroom. Over the summer I put aside my desire to be comfortable and my tendency to be shy and became extroverted and confident in new situations. As a future teacher, I will have to put aside my need to please others and my need to be liked, and will have to adopt a personality of someone who is authoritative, confident and commanding.\n",

      "             Education follows a pattern of stages and transitions. Whether it be the transition from primary to junior, junior to intermediate, or intermediate to senior; each stage presents a shift in the developmental and educational approaches of each students learning abilities. Each transition imposes various adjustments, which may restrict or nurture their educational and developmental needs. This brief paper will investigate and discuss my transition period while beginning my first year of my undergraduate degree.\n",
      "            The approach towards learning in secondary schools and universities are visibly disparate. According to the film “How People Learn: Introduction to Learning Theory (Session 1)”, students learn through first hand investigations. In secondary schools, this notion of learning is supported as students generally include materials and trials in their learning. According to the film, this hands-on approach is commonly followed by text (“How People Learn”, Detroit Public Television) . I benefited from this format of learning. This constructivist style of teaching was beneficial to my learning as it appeared as if I was making discoveries and findings independently. This independence was advantageous as it facilitated a sense of confidence through learning. Furthermore, this constructivist mode of learning promotes a level of individuality and freedom, while continuing to offer support and aid to students. My high school experience was a standard example of this style of learning. I learned most subjects with a general ease. I was confident in my studies and ambitious with my assignments. Following my high school graduation, my plan was to attend Ryerson University to study history. A number of my peers decided to take an extra year at high school, or travel abroad before attending undergraduate studies. Without and little consideration and no hesitation, I began my studies in history in September 2007.\n",
      "            My first year of university was subject to struggle. I found difficulty in keeping up with the fast pace curriculum, the extensive readings and the overwhelmingly large class sizes. Additionally, the assessments offered little creativity and interaction. I was not forced to think for myself during my first year of university, I was encouraged to echo anything mentioned during lessons. This wasn’t useful to my educational development, which led to an increased stress with school. I felt anxious that I was not capable of completing university. My attitudes and esteem towards education and learning shifted towards a completely opposite direction. In retrospect, there are three reasons that could be linked towards this negative shift in my educational development.\n",
      "            The first reason why this negative stint in education occurred was because I lost the ability to apply a first hand approach to how topics are connected.  Secondly, according to Kevin Seifert’s textbook “Educational Psychology” (2011), students must demonstrate a “readiness” in learning. Seifert (2011) explains that with older students, the concept of “readiness” is translated to the knowledge of prerequisites. This means that my knowledge prior to university was not sufficient to foster my learning during my first year of university. Finally, a final reasoning behind my original struggles in university reflects the mode of assessments. Grading was generally limited to short answer testing and final papers. The lack of diversity in assessments influenced my great shift in learning, as I had to learn new evaluation techniques. According to my prior experience, learning did not have boundaries as it could be performed nearly anywhere. In contrast, my university learning was limited to the two-hour one-dimensional lecture (Seifert, 2011). In summary, learning involves a number of stages, which offer various modes of teaching. Each method of teaching has their benefits, yet the adjustment between each stage leads students to experience an original struggle.\n",

      "8,108,2,  There have been many changes in my life that have played a role in shaping me into the person I am today. To date, the most drastic shift in my learning was transitioning from high school to university. I had to adapt socially, cognitively and emotionally. I struggled the most with the development required to my cognitive abilities. My previous learning styles needed to grow and change to compliment a student’s independent life in university.\n",
      "  High school was a wonderful experience for me, both socially and academically. I loved school and the work that came a long with it. However, unlike many of my peers, I learnt in a different way, I had an Individual Educational Plan (IEP). At an early age I was identified as dyslexic. Consequently, there were aspects of learning that were more difficult for me, and as a result, I had to work harder to ensure the grades I wanted. I found some subjects more challenging then others. However, with the influence of teachers who really cared about helping me conquer my battles, I was able to overcome some of these headaches.\n",
      "  Great teachers were a big part of my positive high school experience. They taught in ways that engaged students. They used metacognition techniques to further learning (Donovan, M. S., Bransford J. D., & Pellegrino, J. W., 2000, p.14). The classroom was learner centered and they taught to each students former knowledge and current needs, one really felt like an individual (Donovan, M.S. et al., 2000, p.20-21). In this environment I flourished.\n",
      "  In light of my positive experiences as a high school student, I figured university could only be better. It was not until I showed up to my first lecture, Introduction to Psychology, that my new reality set in. I was surrounded by five hundred students, none of whom I knew, and a scary looking professor with a big white beard sitting at the front of the huge lecture hall. He handed out his syllabus and proceed to go through the readings we had to cover and the assignments and due dates we needed to note. By the end of the week I was completely overwhelmed with all the work I had to accomplish in one semester.\n",
      "  After attending classes for a month, I was very aware that university was nothing like high school. My professors did not know my name, they did not care what my initial understandings and knowledge were about particular topics, and they did not tailor anything to my learning styles. If I was going to succeed in this environment, I needed to adapt the way I learnt to suit the way the professors taught. It was difficult and took some adjusting, but with hard work and determination I got there.\n",
      "Reflecting on my experiences leaves me frustrated. University learning is not set up for success for many students. Many professors do not take into account a students’ preconceptions and initial understanding of a topic. If a teacher pays no attention to a students’ preliminary knowledge, the student may struggle with understanding new concepts because the basics are misunderstood or unknown (Donovan, M.S. et al., 2000, p. 10). Furthermore, students in university have to develop their own competence in inquiry. This requires a deep understanding of foundational knowledge and organizing that information in a way that is easy to understand and access (Donovan, M.S. et al., 2000, p.12). Without guidance this is difficult to achieve.\n",
      "  I looked at my shift in thinking from a constructivist view. I changed my pre-existing ways of learning and learnt to adapt to how my professors were teaching (Seifert, 2011, Chapter 2).\n",
      "  I believe it was my hard work and determination to do well that supported my shift in thinking. This transition was very difficult for me, but helped me to develop great skills that are useful today.\n",

      "              The biggest shift in my adult development happened while I did cognitive behavioral therapy during my last year of university.  For two years prior, I had been in and out of depression and developing anxiety.  In fourth year, I was having daily panic attacks and I felt completely out of control.  I stopped sleeping, socializing, eating, going to work and essentially I just cried.  Finally, I decided to seek professional help, which was the best decision I ever made.\n",
      "              I learned more about myself in therapy than I did during years of school, and I realized that my anxiety and depression had been affecting me behaviorally, cognitively, emotionally and socially for years.\n",
      "              How People Learn explains that “students come to the classroom with preconceptions about how the world works” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000, 10).   I came to my first session with many of my own ideas, but soon after I saw my pre-existing beliefs start to unravel. I started to see how my thoughts, feelings and anxieties were deeply rooted in past experiences and how reluctant I was to let them go, even when presented with other ideas or reasons.\n",
      "              Donovan et al (2000) explains that effective teaching gives students opportunities to recognize their pre-existing understandings and to build on or challenge their initial thoughts. My counselor couldn’t have challenged me more, which gave me the opportunity to confront head on my understandings of the world and myself and to build a new life and identity.\n",
      "              The second finding in How People Learn states that “students must: (a) have a deep foundation of factual knowledge, (b) understand facts and ideas in the context of a conceptual framework, and (c) organize knowledge in ways that facilitates retrieval and application” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 2000, 10). My panic attacks and inability to cope for so long exemplifies a time in my life when I didn’t have any grasp of the above noted things.   Simply put, cognitive behavioral therapy offered me all three and showed me a new way of living, feeling, believing and acting.   To explain, I learned in therapy that anxiety results from wrongly perceiving danger in one’s life and that during my panic attacks I no longer knew what was real or factual.  Within a few sessions, I began to understand my depression and anxiety, as well as the facts of my life and the ideas I had created within the framework of my life situations, and I started to build a new foundation for myself.  I gained a deep understanding of my anxiety and I learned how to transfer my new insights and coping mechanism to new stressors in my life in order prevent or control future moments that would have previously been terrifying.  Eventually, I got rid of my panic attacks altogether.\n",
      "              Not surprisingly, my counselor took a strong metacognitive approach to my journey and encouraged me to be extremely reflective during the entire process.  Though I can happily say that I am beyond both my depression and anxiety today, I recognize how deeply it effected my education and my ability to learn. This is something that I will keep in mind as an educator, as many students may experience the same.\n",

      "        Growing up in a small community outside the city of Toronto hindered both my social and cultural learning. As a child and adolescent, I attended two private schools where most students were of European descent with similar religious values. Students were expected to conform to the strict expectations of the school and the community. Students and teachers abandoned their own ‘individuality’ to support the school’s standards. Reflecting back on my childhood, I recall the students being similar in several aspects. The students came from middle to upper class families, rarely travelled, and lived in large suburban homes. As a result, our knowledge of culture was confined to dominant nationalities such as Italian, Polish, and German. I was a naive individual, sheltered from other cultural and religious norms in Canada.  I once believed that white Catholics were the only Canadians. My social experiences did not involve many interactions with other nationalities, cultures or religions. Since my interactions were restricted, I needed to explore the world and seek new and engaging possibilities for learning.\n",
      "                  Many students enter university with a variety of preconceived notions. Like Heather (A Private Universe, 1987) I found it a struggle to acknowledge that a diverse world existed outside my previous fixed idea. Students have a difficult time grasping concepts that go against their prior beliefs. Children from a young age develop theories about the things around them, based on what they see and hear. When faced with learning new concepts or experiences that go against original ideas, it can be both challenging and resilient for students to accept new information that contradicts their thinking (Donovan, Bransford & Pellegrino, 2000). Upon entering university I was faced with the cultural diversity of Toronto, thus causing me to view the world through a broader lens. As an educator, I will be more sensitive to any preconceived notions that students bring to the classroom. Teachers must be able to recognize any fixed ideas that their students have, and be able to predict where they come from. In addition, we must be willing to work with such preconceptions in order to understand students’ prior knowledge and experiences, and to allow for positive change and development.\n",
      "                   At seventeen, I graduated high school and attended The University of Toronto for my undergraduate career. I was not prepared for the culture shock that I encountered. Surprisingly, I came to realize that Toronto was extraordinarily different for a city relatively close to my hometown. I learned that it was acceptable to demonstrate your own individuality, and share your cultures and beliefs with others. I considered myself part of a large “community” where people expressed their ideas, and celebrated their identity. I made friends of varying religious and cultural backgrounds. I embraced a city that offered new experiences, relationships and an opportunity to develop as a person. Toronto is comprised of various nationalities and beliefs; however, I realized that this does not separate us as individuals. Culture and religion are a means of identification yet we are still people that share life, love, laughter, and kindness.\n",
      "                     As outlined in How we Learn (Donovan et. al, 2000), students are encouraged to take control of their own learning by having goals and examining ways of achieving them. My appreciation for culture and language sparked an interest in travel. My enthusiasm for culture encouraged me to learn two new languages: Spanish and Italian. In my second year of undergrad, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Europe and recently, I spent one month on a cultural exchange to South America to broaden my understanding of Latin American history and tradition. Travel was my solution to finding a new perspective of the world. Upon leaving high school and entering university, I was disappointed by my lack of cultural awareness. I started to question my identity in a world that I knew nothing about. In Erikson’s terms, role confusion was the result (Seifert, 2009, 48-50). As addressed in The Learning Process (Seifert, 2009), students learn from their new experiences and relate them back to their prior knowledge. It is argued that students learn primarily by creating their own knowledge through experiences (Seifert, 2009, 28). My experiences challenged my pre-existing view of the world to embrace cultural and religious differences. Through my growing appreciation for others, I travelled to other countries to learn more about myself and the world around me. My ignorance as a child has blossomed into a passion for culture, language, diversity and travel. Although fearful at first, I have come to appreciate our true \"Canadian identity\": a unique identity comprised of multiple cultures, traditions and religions.\n",

      "8,117,1,            When I started university, I was very confident in my ability to succeed in academics.  I had maintained a high average throughout high school while competing at a national and international level in the sport of competitive swimming.  I was confident in my study habits and time management skills since I had been able to balance school and athletics for years and had been successful in both.  During my first month in university, I applied the same homework and study strategies that I had been using for years and assumed that I would continue to be successful.  I was swimming as a member of the varsity team and was living a similar lifestyle to the one I had experienced in high school.  Unfortunately, when midterms started and I got my marks back, I realized that something had to change.\n",
      "              I was surprised and disheartened when I received my mark for my first university midterm in chemistry: 46%.  Having thought for years that I excelled in the sciences, I didn’t understand how my mark could be so low.  However, as my other marks started to come in, I realized that chemistry wasn’t the only subject that I was struggling with; I was having a difficulty in all of them.  My average had dropped from an 88% in high school, to a 60% in university and I had no idea why.  I started thinking that maybe university wasn’t for me and I continued to struggle.   By the end of first year, I was on academic probation.\n",
      "              I spent the next year of my university career experimenting with a wide variety of study strategies and by the end of the year I was no longer on academic probation.  My grades continued to improve throughout my university career and I think that this was largely related to the metacognitive skills (Donovan, Bransford & Pellegrino, 1999) that I was developing. Donovan et al. (1999) states that each discipline requires a different type of metacognitive monitoring since the information received in various subjects must be interpreted differently.  I was slowly learning this lesson and I began to interpret the information I was receiving in different ways depending on the course.\n",
      "              After reading Donovan et al (1999) and watching “A Private Universe” (1987), I realized that certain important principles of teaching are often overlooked in a university lecture.  In many of the courses that I took during my undergraduate career, professors started directly into material.  They may have started with a brief introduction of what was going to be covered, but they rarely explored students’ preexisting understanding of the subject matter.  Understanding subject matter involves the building upon preconceived notions of that subject and if a student does not have a strong foundational knowledge, they are likely to have difficulty deepening their understanding (Donovan et al, 1999).  In “A Private Universe” (1987), we saw that even after Heather had been taught the correct information about the phases of the moon, she had difficulty moving away from her previous understanding.  I understand that it is difficult to identify student’s preconceived notions in university due to the sheer size of some of the classes.  As a student, I began to recognize this and was able to better succeed by choosing courses in which I was confident that I had a strong foundational knowledge.\n",
      "              The article by Donovan et al. (1999) states that the goal of learning is the development of a deep understanding rather than simply surface knowledge.  Many of the courses that I took in university tested in a way that was only representative of one’s ability to memorize and repeat facts and I was unable to demonstrate whether I had an understanding of the subject matter.  Tying this back to the metacognitive skills that I had developed, I believe that they helped me identify what courses would require me to regurgitate surface knowledge and which ones would allow me to demonstrate my understanding.  I was therefore able to improve my grades by adapting the study strategy I was using depending on the course.\n",

      "8,118,1,  Child and Adolescent Development – Brief Paper\n",
      "              My social development had been relatively normal up until high school.  I always had popular culture in common with my friends and kept up with the most recent cartoon and video game crazes.  This made me who I was, other than being a good student all throughout middle school.  I was in the “crisis of childhood” stage of my development, and, as Erikson states, industry prevailed in my case (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).  I was very comfortable with the way things were going.  I had friends, was quite popular, was doing well in school, and I was having fun.   I had found my niche among my group of friends who were into the same things I was into.\n",
      "  The school that I was in was JK-12, so when I entered high school, I had already had friends from grade eight.  But, I found that people in my class were starting to develop socially in a new direction as puberty was taking place.  The type of humour, which had been “cutting” it in middle school, was now obsolete.  Jokes were becoming more vulgar or “grown up”, and this made me uncomfourtable.  The old popularities of middle school were now seen as nerdy and out of date, but I still liked all those things.  Slowly, the people around me were “changing”, and this determined who I was friends with.  I was no longer one of the popular kids, but I was still a good student, which I took great pride in because it was the only thing that I could relate to with the others.  It felt like the others were in a completely different world then I was in.  They were now talking about relationships and “who liked who”.  I began to feel more isolated and became a social introvert when it came to “their” topics.  This marked one of the most difficult developmental stages that I had to tackle in my whole life, “the crisis of adolescence: identity and role confusion” (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).\n",
      "  As expected, the cliques formed, and I was quite comfourtable in mine.  In the summer of grade nine though, I would be forced to change my “old ways”.  My parents had signed me up to go on an Italian trip with an exchange school, which operated in the GTA.  I would learn Italian in Italy, so it was a good chance to travel and get an extra credit at the same time.  Unfortunately, I would not be going with any school friends.  I was among the youngest kids there.  Most of the people were either grade elevens or twelves.  I was out of my element, and it showed.  My roommate was one of the only friends I had, and even he was trying to get in with the older crowd.  My studious self was not appealing to people because nobody cared about school when they were in Italy.  Students would make fun of the socially undeveloped kids, and I felt more alone than ever before.\n",
      "  I had to make a conscious decision during that summer.  I had to become like them to appeal to them.  “The result is that who a person wants to be may not be the same as who he or she is in actual fact” (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).  I decided to model their humour, and their ability to laugh at their own misfortunes, it seemed.  This was the first time I had to think about my behaviour and how I needed to change it (behaviourism).  It was not difficult to adopt because I had already been exposed to it for a whole year back in high school.  My efforts were paying off, however.  The extrinsic motivation or positive reinforcement given by people laughing at my jokes and accepting my behaviours had conditioned me (operant conditioning) to keep up my efforts and adopt these social behaviours (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 2). To make a long story short, I, as a result of these social influences brought upon by puberty, started to earn respect amongst the older kids.  I carried this on all throughout high school, and it seemed to work on people.  It became who I was developmentally, even though I had not liked it necessarily from the start (or if I look back on it now).  It was the only way I knew how to be accepted and to get people to laugh.\n",
      "              When I entered university, I began to equilibrate socially as I began to tackle a whole new developmental stage,  “the crisis of adulthood” (Seifert, 2011, Ch. 3).  However, I will never forget the great struggles I went through in my adolescent years where I had to consciously and metacognitively make behavioural adjustments to my own life.\n",

      "8,119,2,Never having to study hard for any tests or quizzes, I coasted through my elementary education. I had a good memory and could easily recall course content. This changed when I encountered my grade 8 science teacher, Guy Morey. While most of my previous teachers were friendly, outgoing, and sociable, he was colder, unfriendly, and had very high expectations for his students. On his first test I received 8 out of 15. I was absolutely stunned. I went to my father to complain, but my father showed me no sympathy and simply told me that I had to work harder. I did not take my father’s advice and I continued to coast in Morey’s course, thinking that I would do well regardless. I performed very poorly on all of Guy Morey’s tests and assignments. For our major project, he required all of us to pick a science topic and do research on it. This was the first time that I was to do extra research outside of the classroom. I did not work hard nor did I do extensive research. As a result, I ended up failing the project. For the first time, I was truly afraid that I could have failed the course. Although I did pass the course, it was an eye-opener for me. By the time I reached grade 9, my attitudes had changed toward my schooling and my science teacher. While I still did not like him, I came to the realization that I would have to work hard, and take initiative in order to do well in his courses. I had to raise my game and learn to work. This shift in my thinking became important and a fundamental reason for my later academic success.\n",
      "  One possible explanation for my attitudes toward Guy Morey and my shift in thinking between grade 8 and grade 9 could be based on the theory of Abraham Maslow (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Maslow believed that children go through a variety of needs as they develop from a child to an adolescent (as cited in Seifert, 2011). These needs can be classified into two categories “deficit needs and being needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2). Furthermore, “deficit needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2) must be completed first in order to move on to growing “being needs” (Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2). Unlike my student peers (who were 13), I was 12 years old due to skipping a grade and less mature. I was still at the stage where I needed certain “deficit needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Abraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs, paragraph 2) filled. In particular, I was in the “love and belonging needs” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Deficit needs: getting the basic necessities of life, paragraph 2) stage. However, Guy Morey was not the caring, nurturing teacher that I probably required at the time.\n",
      "  A year later in grade 9, I was most likely in a stage of transition and was moving toward having “cognitive needs (a desire for knowledge and understanding)” (as cited in Seifert, 2011, Being needs: becoming the best that you can be, paragraph 1). Therefore, I no longer needed a teacher to be warm, kind, and sincere as Maslow theorized (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Instead, I was more interested in working hard for Guy Morey and I wanted to show him that I was not a lousy student (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Most importantly, I wanted to show him that I was interested in what he was teaching and that I had a thirst for knowledge, all of which Maslow believed would occur in a child’s growth (as cited in Seifert, 2011). Since grade 8 Science, I transitioned from a smart yet lazy student into a driven, hard working student and someone who took pride in his accomplishments.\n",
      "  Today Guy Morey is a teacher that I fondly remember. He taught me the importance of hard work and the value of gaining self-knowledge, and I feel he is an important catalyst for becoming the person that I am today. One of his life-long lessons that he taught me wasn’t even in his Science class but when he substituted for health class. He asked the class, “How do you know when something has true value?” When none of us could answer he then responded “When it’s gone”. Never has any answer been more poetic. He no longer teaches at my old high school and I wish that I had the opportunity to tell him what an important influence he was in my life. I hope someday that I will.\n",

      "8,120,1,   As I started to brainstorm for this assignment I tried to recall a personal preconception that was disputed in school or through my life experiences. I thought this was an interesting place to start because research shows that the process of making sense of the world begins at a young age (Bransford, 1999, p.10). What came to mind was an incident that challenged my previous moral and spiritual conceptions. Neither of my parents are deeply religious, however I was raised in a catholic household, was baptized before my first birthday and attended a Catholic Elementary School. For the first five years of my life I attended Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church on Sundays. One Sunday when I was five years old my sister who was seven asked my mom, “why are there only alter boys and not alter girls?” My mother could not come up with an answer for my sister. Shortly after this day we stopped attending the Catholic Church and my mother joined CNWE (Catholic Network for Women’s Equality.) Both my sister and I often attended CNWE meetings with my mother and were introduced to a diverse group of spiritual men and women who believed in the Catholic religion but challenged its contemporary institutions. My mother also brought us to a faith community called RUAH that focused on ecology and spirituality. Ruah accepted all members as leaders regardless of their gender or sexuality. These transitions marked a cognitive, social, emotional and moral sift in how I derived my spiritual beliefs.\n",
      "           Despite still attending a Catholic school with religious classes I took what I was taught at face value and outside of school reverted back to my belief that the church could be challenged. My mother and family obviously had a large impact in this shift but so did my school. I realized, as did my sister, that there were inconsistencies in what we were being taught. I had learned in school and at home that all people, regardless of their gender, sexuality, religion or race were equal but I was receiving different messages from the church. The Church never addressed these contradictions or engaged me in critical thinking leaving it easy for me to keep my new opinions when I left the classroom (Brasford, 1999, p.10). I have learned to accept some of the messages of the Catholic Church and disregard others. I am still a spiritual person, but the source of my spirituality is derived from a variety of ideas, people, and locations.\n",
      "           A skepticism of the Catholic Church coupled with life experiences continues to shape my perspective. My father left home when I was a young girl. Growing up I assumed, like many do, that I would get married and “live happily ever after.” Now I wonder if marriage is realistic. Although I know that marriage is present in most cultures and in most religions, I also know that if I still had the conception of the Church as the ultimate authority I probably would not question the value of marriage. At a young age I experienced a moral, social and cognitive shift when I learned that I was able to challenge the Church. This shift continues to have an impact on me today; for example, I am comfortable disagreeing not just with the Church but also with other powerful institutions.\n",

      "8,121,6,       Over the course of my twenty-three year life, I have spent approximately 23, 040 hours in a classroom.  Consequently, much of my cognitive, social, emotional, and moral development has taken place within a school setting.  Although I can recall many times when I experienced a shift in my own development in each of these respective areas, this brief reflection draws upon a time from when I was 10 years old.\n",
      "         My father’s family is of Armenian descent.  When my dad’s family immigrated to Canada in 1962, my grandfather was especially concerned that his children would lose their Armenian culture and language.  Although it was a great sacrifice for my grandparents at the time, they decided to fund an Armenian school and community center, which today remains a vital part of the Toronto Armenian community.   When it came time for my parents to decide what school I should attend as a student entering Kindergarten, it was only natural for my parents to send me to the Armenian school, where I remained a student until the end of grade four.  When I attended the Armenian school, many years ago, the teachers used very conventional teaching methods.  Our classrooms often reflected monotonous scenes, similar to those one might find in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Whether it was a direct consequence of these teaching methods, or the lack of extracurricular activities offered at the school, my parents and I decided to look at different schools.  When I was accepted to the Bishop Strachan School (BSS) for grade five, I knew immediately I wanted to become a student there.\n",
      "         The classrooms at BSS resembled very little of what I was used to from my time at the Armenian school where there was no implementation of metacognition, I was simply not thinking and not encouraged to think about what I was learning.  On the other hand,   my teachers at BSS were constantly interacting with students on a level I was unfamiliar with.  Activities in the classroom were very collaborative and hands-on.  Students were encouraged to play a more active role in their learning process. Consequently, I was forced to undergo certain developmental shifts, namely cognitive and social, to keep up with my new peer group.  Even though I was socially interacting with a group of students I was completely unfamiliar with for the first time in as long as I could remember, I still found the cognitive shift to be the more challenging of the two.\n",
      "         Not having taken a Psych course before, I have never formally examined the process of my own learning and development.  However, reading Donovan, Bransford and Pellegrino’s How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice, allowed me to draw on specifically what it was about BSS teaching and learning that was so different from what I had experienced at the Armenian school.  This text highlights an overview of research “on learners and learning and on teachers and teaching” (Donovan et al., 2000).  One of the outcomes of the research presented suggests that a “metacognitive approach to instruction can help students learn to take control of their own learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them” (Donovan et al., 2000).  This is precisely what learning looked like in a BSS classroom.  For the first time, I was taught metacognitive strategies, “including the ability to predict outcomes, explain to oneself in order to improve understanding, note failures to comprehend, activate background knowledge, plan ahead, and apportion time and memory” (Donovan et al, 2000).  Initially, I had a very difficult time keeping up with my classmates.  I struggled with the idea that we did not come to school to rely solely on the teacher for our “learning”.  As metacognition became an integral part of classroom teaching and learning I grew more comfortable with the idea that I was responsible for my own learning.  The idea that I was capable of presenting my own understanding of an antagonist in a book or suggesting a hypothesis for a science experiment for instance, instead of the hypothesis being stated for me by the teacher, was initially very unnatural.  This cognitive shift did not happen quickly.  It was perhaps not until I reached middle school that I began to feel comfortable with the idea of reciprocal teaching and less traditional forms of learning and teaching in the classroom, most of which fell under a metacognitive umbrella.\n",
      "         In hindsight I feel very fortunate to have received the education at BSS that I did.  Although learning is a continuous process, I feel my education at BSS is what truly allowed for me to flourish while at university.  Acquiring metacognitive knowledge greatly contributed to my success at the undergraduate level.  Being aware, both, of my thinking and variables that affect my thinking are invaluable skills that I hope to bring to the classroom as I shift from student to teacher.\n",

      "8,123,2,  Up until my university years, I would have said the cause of smiling was simple: a stranger smiled at me, and I smiled back.  Note the qualifier – this did not apply to friends and family.  But when I interacted with strangers, smiling was a reaction, not the default.  I liked to be quiet and observe; I did not like to talk.\n",
      "  This was a result of both personality and upbringing.  I was an only child and comfortable in my own skin, but often unsure how to interact with others.  For many years I was reserved and introverted; I made few friends and fewer acquaintances.  This state remained throughout high school and much of university.  Despite frequent changes in surroundings and environments, it never occurred to me to change my approach in socializing.\n",
      "  However, in my third year of university I studied for one year in Nantes, France, and my outlook changed dramatically.  I was frightened to be 10,000 kilometres away from home, and apprehensive about living in a country whose customs, mores, traditions, and language were different from my own.  But the observer’s role I had thus far embraced would not have sufficed – I badly wanted to perfect my French, and I could not do so by remaining an observer.  In other words, I could not learn if I was not prepared to do so, mentally and psychologically.\n",
      "  I initially found it difficult to break through the language barrier and years of friendship already forged in French school systems.  Ironically however, it was this very reserve that gave me my breakthrough.  My experience was that the Nantais were friendlier than the dreaded Parisians, but still they were vaguely xenophobic.  If I asked for directions in my passable French, I was helped grudgingly, morosely, and with a vaguely judgmental air.  Yet if I smiled widely before asking their aid – as if to acknowledge implicitly my inherent ignorance, but I beg them humbly to bear with this poor lost foreigner – then they would smile back, or might compliment me on my fine French accent (for a North American), and proceed to direct me along my way.\n",
      "  In other words, I had become a classic example of the Skinner model of operant conditioning (Seifert, 2011, pp.23-24).  Smiling was the operant, and as soon as I get the help I needed, it reinforced my behaviour.  Put in social terms and viewed retrospectively, it seems like common sense – people cannot read each other’s minds, and a smile coupled with a “Thank you” is more powerful than words alone.\n",
      "  Later, I carried my experiences forward during my time in New Zealand, where the sheer openness and friendliness of the New Zealanders reinforced what the French had begun.  It became natural for me to smile rather than to remain staid and expressionless, and by extension I have become more actively engaged in communicating with people.  The change became more or less permanent – and that, I believe, is what Seifert would call true learning (Seifert, 2011, p. 15).\n",

      "8,124,1,             I have grown up in a multi – racial family.  My father is from India, and my mother is 5th generation Canadian, her background being Scottish.  To me, my family would have been considered the ‘norm.’  I never thought any differently of my family compared to another and assumed that all students would have either been from, associated with, or aware of multi – racial and/or cultural families.  However, this entire preconception was challenged early on in my life.  I was in Grade 4 and it was the beginning of the school year.  I was standing at the back of the baseball diamond, located on the field beside the student pick– up parking lot.  It was nearing the end of the day and I was waiting for my parents.  When they arrived, they both got out of the car and walked towards the field in order to sign me out.  As they approached the field, another student stopped, starred at my parents and then turned to me.  He asked if my parents were married, and I replied by telling him yes.  He then stated that my parents should not be married because they did not look the same.  My immediate reaction was to get emotional and become extremely confused.  I remember walking away, getting in the car and feeling as if my entire family, its structure, and who I was, was being questioned and “not right.”\n",
      "            This incident created a huge shift in my development, cognitively, socially, and emotionally.  According to one of the three insights on learning in the article How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice, Donovan, Bransford, and Pellegrino (1999) stated “Students come to the classroom with preconceptions about how the world works.”  This notion applies to my shift, because my understanding that everyone came from the same type of family or at least was aware of my family dynamic changed drastically.  I became conscious of other students possible preconceptions as well as my own.  I realized that I should be aware of how each student did not come from the same place that I did.  It is here that my shift directly relates to one of the ideas in How People Learn.  Donovan et al (1999) stated that if student’s initial preconceptions are not engaged, then they may not grasp new concepts and ideas that are taught.  Although this incident was not an academic learning process, I became aware of how my preconceived notions were challenged.  Thus resulting in a cognitive shift in my development, where my idea and understanding of families changed.\n",
      "            In discussing the incident with my parents they informed me that maybe that particular student was not exposed to multi – racial families.  They said that I was not to be mad at him, or immediately put on the defensive if this situation were ever to arise again, because people are and aren’t exposed to the same things. We are all different, and everyone should be accepted for his or her individuality.  This then drove my emotional shift, which has changed me as a person.  I became less sensitive to questions related to my family, and built a stronger sense of confidence.  I learned not to become upset but to gain a deeper understanding of students and tell them about different families, this made me feel like a teacher myself.  This emotional shift in my development led into my social shift.  I became more secure and confident.  I discovered who I was and where I came from.  Furthermore, besides becoming more open minded and aware of each student’s differences, I became more conscious of what it was that I would say to others, so as to not offend or upset them, as I was.  Overall, this incident affected many areas of my development.  It has helped to shape who I am, how I deal with certain situations, and how I understand and recognize the differences of each and every individual student.  Conclusively this was one of the greatest and deepest shifts in my personal development.\n",

      "Hi, my name is Joe. I consider myself to be friendly and outgoing. I wasn’t always like this though. For the first half of my life, I was an introvert and very quiet. Even as a baby my mom says I barely cried (sorry Kim, I don’t know how to cite my mother under the APA guidelines). I experienced a big change in my personality and social life from grade eight to grade ten. It happened primarily because of, from what I can tell, biological and social influences.\n",
      "  In middle school, I was a weird kid. I didn’t have a good sense of humour and I wasn’t able to laugh at myself. I was pretty socially awkward. I had some friends at school and church, but I had no deep connections with them. In the summer after grade eight, I went on a church camping trip. I learned one of the girls had a crush on me. I was approached by her friends and asked if I liked her too. I didn’t know what to say and I was very confused so I said yes. I was dragged out (literally) to the beach by my friends and she was there with her friends. Unfortunately, I became stricken with anxiety and nervousness. I didn’t know what to do so I ran away from the beach. I ran as fast as I could into the forest. My friends chased after me and dragged me back. I then asked her out, like my friends and I had rehearsed earlier and, shockingly, she agreed. Needless to say, the relationship was short lived (about two weeks if I remember correctly). It seems trivial but I believe it marked the beginning of my developmental moratorium (Sadowski, 2003, p. 11).\n",
      "  When I entered grade nine, I met some very important and influential people. They were incredibly outgoing and I admired their personalities. They had great senses of humour and were always able to laugh at themselves. The new teachers I was surrounded with were extremely kind and caring. They taught me a lot about life and prepared me for the future. They were great role models for me. Because of my new social environment, I felt that I developed a lot. I grew into someone who was not socially awkward anymore. I was able to laugh at myself and make jokes that made others laugh. I became much more outgoing too.\n",
      "  I can imagine operant conditioning (as cited in Seifert, 2011) had a lot to do with this process. Through my initial attempts at humour, I would have used my friends’ responses as feedback to guide my own behaviour. In other words, if I told a joke and they laughed, I would continue to tell similar jokes. Through this conditioning, my sense of humour developed. If I were to look at my development from a constructivist perspective (as cited in Seifert, 2011), then I can see that there was a lot of social constructivism happening. I would take indirect cues from them in social situations. For example, if they were being extraverted, I would feel an invitation to be extraverted also. If the experience was positive, I would assimilate this information and thereafter would understand when and where a certain amount of extraversion is acceptable.\n",
      "  From a biological perspective, my brain continued to develop throughout these years. My cognitive skills, in general, became better, faster and more efficient. I was beginning to be able to process and analyse social situations in better ways I wasn’t able to before. Actually, the development of this nature has continued well past grade ten. I can’t even assume this process has finished. I know that the brain, more specifically the prefrontal cortex, doesn’t completely finish developing until about your mid-20s. I know this part of the brain controls executive functions like planning and decision making, but I believe these functions can be very important in social situations too.\n",
      "  By the time I was in grade ten, I was a very different person from a few years earlier. My development into such a different person was relatively quick. By no means does this mean I finished my social development though. I continued to tweak my personality (sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously) throughout high school and my university undergrad. Tweaking still happens today, although much less frequently than in high school. I also run away from girls much less frequently these days.\n",

      "8,126,1,Teaching and learning are most often associated with school and particularly the classroom setting (Seifert 2008).  Although, throughout our academic careers we experience growth, I believe that important shifts in development, whether it be cognitive, moral, social or emotional occur over time and usually when and where we least expect it.  Development in general is a lifelong process and its implications are not always evident until much later in our lives.\n",
      "  This was certainly the case with my development upon entering my first year of university. I enrolled in the Bachelor of Science Program at the University of Toronto in the area of Life Sciences. Coming from high school, where I excelled as a student, I thought that my academic success would continue in University. This idea was quickly confuted after the first round of midterms and definitely after completing my first year where my grades were far from great. This drastic reversal led me to seek advice from family, counsellors, as well as from past and present teachers. After much discussion and research it was clear to me that it was my anxiety surrounding tests and exams that interfered with my ability to achieve the grades that I wanted and deserved. Upon realizing this I thought that my problems were finally over and that I would return to achieving great marks; this however was not the case.\n",
      "  I was unable to deal with my anxiety because I was unwilling to admit that it was a problem for me.  It was hard for me to admit that I, a twenty year old could have a mental health issue that was severe enough to inhibit my ability to focus, retain knowledge and perform on tests. Often misconceptions and preconceived notions affect one’s ability to grasp new information (Donovan et al., 2000). This was true for me as my ideas surrounding anxiety prevented me from coming to terms with my own feelings and, from understanding and accepting the information provided to me by my doctor. Everything began to change for me once I accepted my situation and the fact that I needed to seek help in order to overcome this obstacle. Upon seeking treatment I witnessed great improvement in my marks which in turn increased my motivation and determination as a student.\n",
      "  I believe that this “metacognitive” approach to thinking about my learning (Donovanet al., 2000) truly saved my academic career. I was able to take a step back and reflect on what may be the reason for my poor marks. I feel I grew as a person that year because I realized that one’s cognitive development is not just a result of how much one studies or learns in a classroom but that it can be affected by various factors including one’s own health. I learned that it is important to take care of myself and put “mind over matter”. This developmental shift has influenced the way I look at life and the way I approach situations. Prior to this experience I often pulled all-nighters, pushed myself to the limit and overthought many assignments/tests. I now approach learning with a calmer demeanour and this has helped me to achieve my academic goals more than I thought was possible.\n",

It’s you who you need to cherish and worry about losing, not your family, your friends.  Your family will always be your family, and friendship can be a flexible thing.  You can choose to lead a life, or you can choose to end it.” - Crisis Counsellor, October 2002.\n",
      "  The issue of who has control over one’s life is an important one for a teen.  Often times youth are bombarded with images from society on how their life should be, pressures and assumptions from parents and sometimes educators on the standards they should be living up to, and often times what their goals for themselves are.  Life becomes a very complicated mixture of ideas, thoughts and beliefs, of what life should be, Piaget would call these individual thoughts and ideas schema, and in the case of the larger concept/expectation of life, schemata, the combination of my thinking and my interpretation of others beliefs about my life would be called my cognitive equilibrium (Seifert).   Well, sometimes things shift, my cognitive equilibrium began to get weighed down, those thoughts and beliefs became too much for me to handle, and my own preconceived and developing notions of how I wanted my life to be, began to fade away, leaving me with others ideas, notions and expectations piling up.  That was when things became complicated.  The tables began to turn, and things began to get twisted.  It became a very dark time for my life.  Still though, even through treatment for my problem, I would leave happy, joyous and excited to take on the world, my equilibrium adjusted in a more positive light, but within a few days it would sink down again.  My personal thoughts weren’t able to keep up with the barrage of others ideas and beliefs.  It really became unbearable.\n",
      "  My significant change in thought came from someone who taught me how to prioritize those thoughts, to isolate which ones were mine, and to look deeper at those collections of beliefs.  Suddenly my schemata were back in my control.  I didn’t have to have a perfect grade, that’s not what it meant to be a student, being a student meant learning.  I didn’t need to ‘protect’ my mother, she was a grown woman, and she could do that herself.  I could challenge those notions, I could, in a sense teach myself to edit my beliefs and what does become imprinted on my memory.  Just as I learned to be stressed and perfectionist over school-work, I could learn to let go when it became detrimental to my health.  There were many other lessons I needed, and still need to relearn and revisit to restore my cognitive equilibrium, but I least now I am a little more confident as an educator.  I still have a lot of things to teach myself.,\n",
      "8,128,1,Partway through my undergraduate degree, I got the sense that the act of listening was a good deal more complicated than I had previously thought. I will focus on listening, but the shift I experienced in listening was part of a general broadening of awareness. I began to realize that my perspective was mine only, and that others necessarily saw the world differently, and wanted different things. It sounds like a very obvious thing to know, but I cannot exaggerate how significantly understanding this began to change the way I related to the world around me.\n",
      "  At around the age of twenty, I began to notice patterns that had been many years in the making. Though appearing in different realms of my life, they shared distinct qualities. In school, for example, I would be returned assignments for which I had received very poor grades, despite having submitted what I thought to be excellent work. Like Heather in the video we watched, I believe I could not see beyond my own initial point of understanding in order to answer the question being asked me, or to understand what was being taught (A Private Universe, 1987). The resulting feelings were indignation and anger, and instead of focusing on a grader’s justification and feedback, I chalked it up to some wrongness in my assessor, or in ‘the system’. Similarly, people with whom I was close would, in my opinion, be at fault whenever there was conflict between us. Sometimes, those relationships deteriorated seriously, and I would walk away from them feeling angry and hurt, but confident in the knowledge that I was not at fault.\n",
      "  Growing up, argument was my family’s default mode of discourse and ‘being right’ its most coveted prize.  Arguing was not about understanding or compromise. The aim was to be heard, and to do so you had to be loud, interrupt and shame and punish those who did not agree with you. Tuning out those who were louder and more violent became necessary to maintaining sanity. This is probably at least partly how I learned not to listen. My learning to tune out may be seen through a Skinnerian lens, the behaviour being reinforced by the pleasure of escape (Seifert, 2011, pp.23-24).\n",
      "  In univeristy, I began to notice that I was not listening, and also that I was becoming inappropriately angry and aggressive when I had arguments with my friends, loved ones and classmates. A conversation with a friend planted the seed of change in my mind. As she spoke about the challenge of listening to really hear and understand, before making judgments, forming counter arguments or tuning out, I nodded gamely, as though I already had already known what she was saying. But her words stuck with me, and I slowly became aware that, especially when agitated, I would fail to listen. Eventually I developed what I think could be described as a conscious strategy of meta-cognitive monitoring to become aware of when I am not really listening (Donovan et al., 2000). Once aware, I could refocus myself and try to let go of my own thoughts. I have practiced this for the past few years, and it has been helpful. Slowly, I am learning how to listen.\n",

      "8,129,1,Before receiving a course schedule or attending orientation week, my first experience affiliated with the University of Toronto was trying-out for the Men’s Varsity Blues baseball team. The baseball season is a fall sport therefore tryouts occur in August before classes begin. I was a young 17 year old student athlete fresh out of high school trying to make the team with players ranging in age from seventeen-thirty. I remember feeling anxious, I was unaware of the format of the league, I didn’t know how I would be able to manage school work with baseball, and how I would fit in with the veteran team culture. Currently I am entering my sixth season on the team, over the past six years I have developed in all aspects of the game both on and off the field. Throughout my time on the team, I have and will continue to develop both socially and emotionally, learning about myself and the dynamics of the team.\n",
      "  Last season I was appointed team captain, and with this title came more responsibilities. Comparing it to my rookie season, socially it was much different. I had to lead by example in order to help establish team concepts and guide the younger players. I am still able to joke around and have fun with the team, yet I feel as if I am under a microscope. Some of the younger players do look up to the veteran leaders for information, leadership, reinforcement and guidance. I have developed emotionally over the past six seasons. Baseball is a sport like no other, with time to make decisions before every pitch some believe it is the ultimate chess-match in sport. Early in my career, I have let my emotions get the best of me. I was tossed out of games by the umpire, and have thrown equipment out of frustration. I am an emotional player, but I have learned how to manage my emotions. There have been times this year where I have been frustrated, however I believe that I am more mentally tough. I am more aware of my role on the team and the effect that my actions may have on my teammates. Baseball is a game that is played with your hands and feet, but it is won with your head and your heart.\n",
      "  My development over the years as a student athlete can be looked at through a number of different psychological theories including operant conditioning. For example arguing with an umpire (the operant) results in getting kicked out of the current game and missing the next game (the reinforcement) (Skinner, B.F. 1988). Now I am essentially missing two games where I am unable help contribute to the team. Over the last six years I have matured from a young 17 year old student-athlete into who I am today. I will continue to learn and develop helping to educate and lead from my past experiences gained at the University of Toronto.\n",

      "8,130,1,  Throughout school, I was all too aware of my difficulty expressing myself. I was astute enough to recognize that something was missing, I just couldn’t figure out what. I approached my teachers, my family doctor, and my parents; they claimed my concerns were “all in my head”, that I was socially acceptable enough, academically able enough, and clearly happy enough - for a teenager. They believed my frustrations were mere teenage angst, and, like some mild cold, would pass. I still remember their voices: “You’re fine. You’re just being a perfectionist. Some people just aren’t good at everything”. It is hard to believe in yourself, when everyone tells you (with apparent affection) that you’re only capable of so much.\n",
      "  After a few long years of struggling and a failed university paper that shook me enough to find a doctor in Toronto for an assessment,  I was diagnosed with a learning disability (Educational Psychology, 2009, p. 125) in my second year at U of T.  This experience caused a monumental shift in my life. Though, I can easily argue that this was a cognitive, social and emotional shift, I would like to focus on my emotional response, for the sake of those who may understand learning disabilities only from the perspective of an educational or learning deficit.\n",
      "  Living with an undiagnosed learning disability is akin to being trapped in the body of a mime. One goes through the actions of learning with varying effectiveness, only able to produce a caricature of expression. By not exemplifying the discrepancy model (LDAO, Learning Disabilities: a new definition, 2001), where a student fails to meet educational standards, no one attributed my personal struggle to a disability. As one of my favorite teachers said, “If you had ADD, you would be bouncing off the walls, and look at you, you’re fine”.\n",
      "  Many would assume the revelation of being diagnosed would be enlightening - a breath of fresh air - and yet, it only heightened the emotions that were brewing under the surface. In my mind, I had always known that there was something different about me, but being labeled “disabled” affirmed all my worst irrational fears - that I was stupid, a failure, and that wasn’t cut out for academia. Somehow, being told I was fine, was almost better than finding out, I wasn’t. Four years later, I understand intellectually that a learning disability is not the same as an intellectual or developmental disability - but it is still sometimes difficult to shake the conditioned negative response (Seifert, p.19) associated with my abilities as a learner in the classroom setting.  In many ways, my diagnosis created anxiety, where there was none previously.\n",
      "  In sharing this shift in my own emotional experience, I hope that it may help others to understand how complex the emotional experience of a disability is. Moreover, I hope that my experience offers motivation for others to learn more about the experience of students with learning disabilities, so that you may be able to better assist students in any classroom setting.\n",

      "            When I was growing up, I was the type of students that always had his head in the clouds, never did homework (not for a lack of really wanting to), and always forgot about the scheduling of assignments and tests. My teachers and parents told me to really apply myself, “you can do better”, but only if I would apply myself. Fast-forward to second year of university where I was diagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I have never felt stigmatized in regards to my ADHD, nor did I ever feel that it affected my intelligence, but I was seriously annoyed at the amount of time it took me to do school work relative to my classmates.\n",
      "            Following this very late diagnosis, I learned some cognitive methods to help with ADHD and tried some medications. There was a stark contrast between my newfound concentration ability and my old one. I was suddenly able to get over 5-7 pages of material and hour rather than a paragraph per day. After this experience, I noticed that my baseline attention had increased, making life quite easier for me in every day circumstances. By increasing my focus to normal levels, I was able to enhance my memory encoding and retrieval, as well enhance my mental math skills, which require a good working memory for juggling numbers.\n",
      "           One of the major learning techniques we have at our disposal (and are repeatedly encouraged to use it) is metacognition, that is, thinking about the way we think. Following a protocol for managing ADHD increased my level of attention for sustained periods of time, allowing me to better engage in metacognition.\n",
      "            The text gives a good background on the difficulties of having a faulty attention span; “Experts are also able to fluently access relevant knowledge because their understanding of subject matter allows them to quickly identify what is relevant. Hence, their attention [italics mine] is not overtaxed by complex events” (Donovan, Bransford, & Pellegrino, 1999). In my many academic duties, I often found myself unable to deal with complex events because it took so much energy to stay on task that I would often give up. This is interesting because my ability to retrieve data as improved due to an increase in attention (this fits the quoted model above).\n",
      "            My shift was not limited to academics. It also shifted the development of my emotional state, my sociability, my health, etc. I knew I was finally realizing my true potention, I became more confident in myself, and somehow became more extroverted. To me, the change was almost as dramatic as a child leaving the preoperant stage for the operant stage. This goes to show how important one factor in the functioning of the whole brain can negatively impact global functioning if it is lacking. As a result, I will definitely be more aware, and maybe even be on the look out for students that suffer from this oft ignored disability in order to get them the help they need early on and minimize the adverse effects weaken the building blocks on which their future education would rest.\n",

This was at a party my mother and I attended: a somewhat regular occurrence, as my mother was a single parent who couldn't always afford a babysitter. When we arrived home, she asked me what I thought about various party guests. When she asked about S______, I don't remember exactly how I described him, but in response she told me, “S______ is your father.”\n",

Before meeting my father, I was clearly confused about this, at one point giving my uncle a Father's Day card while he was temporarily living with us. This was an attempt to assimilate (as cited in Seifert, 2011) my uncle's presence in my life with my understanding of what a father was. I worked with the evidence available—he was an adult male who lived with me and my mother—and came to an incorrect conclusion.\n",
      "  It is difficult for me to gauge the effects of this delayed exposure to my own father. Over the last two decades, he and I have worked hard to create a relationship that reflects and fosters our connection to one another; however, I feel on a basic level that I still have not accommodated (as cited in Seifert, 2011) for his presence in my life. He is the one who feels like an uncle to me, because he wasn't present during the formative stages of my life. When I was learning to “approach toddlerhood with a basic sense of trust in [my] caretakers” (Erikson, 1968, as cited in Nakkula, 2008), he was not one of them. In any situation where a father's guidance might be welcome, I have instead an individual whom I know to be biologically related to me, but whose potential influence on my life is minimized by his absence early on. This is not to say that I don't accept or respect him as my father, but simply that our relationship doesn't make perfect sense to me. It is a cognitive itch that I will never stop scratching. Who is this person in relation to me? What vested interest does he have in my success? Should I follow his advice? Why?\n",
      "  In critically examining the fundamental nature of fathers, I take on an outsider's perspective. I am still, emotionally and cognitively, a fatherless child. I am still navigating my emotions and thoughts as they relate to my family dynamic. I am still questioning the very concept of family. For these reasons and more, I cannot say this shift has come to an end. I have been engaged in a struggle for cohesion for the majority of my life, and it continues to this day. I remain hopeful that I will develop some deeper understanding of my father, because I truly love him—I just find it difficult to relate.\n",

      "8,134,2,  I have rarely felt more shame than the Christmas morning, 2009, Kigali, Rwanda, when my friend stumbled upon my backpack and its contents.  Her accusatory stare spoke as only someone else who has had their bag torn asunder at the border in search of this counter-band could; faced with that look, I stumbled through my explanation of the contents.\n",
      "  Yet no explanation could deny what was sitting there for all the world to see,  cocooning my week’s worth of supplies:\n",
      "  That white plastic bag.\n",
      "  Plastic bags are illegal in Rwanda. You can’t buy them in country and there are rigorous checks at the border.  I still blush when I recall the situation.  For the first time in my memory, I took advantage of a position of trust.   I had plastic bags lining my clothes to keep them dry.  Being perfectly well aware that diplomatic privilege is limited to the country of accreditation (Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, p.4), I waved my Canadian red passport at the guard at the Burundi-Rwanda border, pled with him on the grounds of my integrity as ‘one government official to another’, and without one single word of untruth I managed to slip that forbidden white substance through.  The feeling of smug satisfaction and my dry underwear followed me all the way to the capital.\n",
      "  As an accredited diplomat at the Canadian embassy in Zimbabwe, I was habituated to being waved through police road blocks and express lines at border crossings.  I had been subject to over a year of classical conditioning in my interactions with officials (Pavlov, as cited in Seifert, 2011, p.19). Suddenly, on vacation, I was out of that context, in a very similar region but no longer privy to the “rights” I had so recently enjoyed.  What had started as a privilege to aid me in my work had become an entitlement which I carried with me through the unconscious process of generalization (Pavlov, as cited in Seifert, 2011, p.22).\n",
      "  The conversation with my friends that morning forced me to consider the learning that I had undergone.  Utilising metacognition  (Seifert, 2011, p.31)  I was able to assess how much transfer, both positive and negative, there had been of that learning on other areas of my life (Pavlov, as cited in Seifert, 2011, p.22). This was a pertinent question as that attitude was fundamentally contradictory to my values as well as every experience with authority I had ever experienced prior to that past year.\n",
      "  In combating that change, for me it was incredibly important to return to Zimbabwe as an individual after my posting ended, unprotected by and from the mechanisms of power.  At the end of my posting I took some training in Canada and then returned, to the promise of a job in a local boarding school, the situation reversed; completely and utterly at the mercy of the government’s immigration system.  Work permit’s fell through, tourist visa ran out, and I decided to leave given a myriad of factors, including the desire for certification.  A certain amount of fatigue after various encounters with border guards, youth militia, and police had also taken their toll.  And so, I left the land of endless summer and went ‘’home” directly into a culture more foreign than that of Africa; into Quebec, with language immersion, incomprehension and frosty temperatures the rule of the day.  Eight months later, more than three years after my original departure, I’m finally re-entering ‘my’ culture, still very much processing what learning has taken place these past years.\n",
      "    Given I am on a leave of absence, I am often asked if I will ever return to the government in a facilitation or educational systems support function. I hesitate, as although I now own a Dry Peak Bagger in which to wrap my things, the thought of returning still conjures the lingering feeling of that oh-so-slippery plastic.\n",

      "8,136,1,Here is a picture of a heptagon!,\n",
      "8,137,15,Perhaps the most potent experience for my educational growth was simply the realization of my younger brother’s taking command of his life, and thereafter my shifting perceptions of the achievement paradigm as a function of school culture. Although we lived in the same house, sadly, Clinton and I rarely interacted. It seemed like we were too different in too many aspects to be able to communicate on the same page. As well, we had too many of our own selfish ambitions in our agenda to make sibling bonding a priority. I was outgoing and easy-going; street smart, and sociable, and always up for adventure or hands-on activity. My school, Upper Canada College, celebrated this persona as a hallmark of a good learner, contributor, and overall global citizen. Students were implicitly conditioned to uphold values of such citizenship through constant peer and faculty support as well as collaborative class assignments. It became apparent to me that the UCC culture operated on a hybrid of respondent and operant conditioning (Seifert, 2011). \"Bleed Blue\" school slogans were coupled with announcements of upcoming sporting tournaments in Monday assemblies. Friday assemblies would celebrate the camaraderie, teamwork, and initative in attaining victories at those sporting tournaments.\n",
      "  On the other hand, Clinton kept to himself, though not necessarily because he was shy; given his extremely disciplined and overly pragmatic nature, he set his own ironclad deadlines for all concrete goals at the expense of a social life. Why attend a Raptors game when he could learn a new language on Rosetta Stone while loading a five minute-long Raptors highlight reel on YouTube? Why join friends for pizza when he could read articles about the Higgs Boson while having a pizza and just chat with them next class? Yes, University of Toronto Schools students were widely stereotyped as nerdy, but this must have been something exceptional!\n",
      "  Over the years, family and friends tended to judge us by our immediate results, as was a hobby for many traditional Chinese parents. Thus, while my short-term achievements were praised and supposedly promised greatness in the near future, Clinton was labeled as the unemotional, near-robotic recluse who lived in our piano room-turned-private study, much like a mad scientist’s underground den. Our family couldn’t penetrate his shell—whenever we asked what he was up to on his computer and electronic keyboard, he would respond, “Just working on a few things. Trust me, I know what I’m doing!”\n",
      "  “What did you learn at school?”\n",
      "“Very interesting things.”\n",
      "“Like?”\n",
      "“Well okay, math was pretty boring, so I just read Alex’s German textbook and taught myself some phrases. It’s okay, the teacher never sees me!”\n",
      "  Months later, Clinton received news that he had won a Toronto-wide German contest and was invited to live with a foster family for a week in Germany this summer, with all expenses paid for. On the same day, he was elected by his classmates to be UTS’s 2011 Graduating Class valedictorian. Other impossible last-minute stunts for an unemotional recluse included winning silver medals at the International Biology Olympiad, composing original orchestral scores for UTS’s musical concerts, competing alongside nationally-ranked fencers at circuits and exhibitions, and now being a regular contributor to three campus newspapers and journals in his current freshman year at Yale University while carrying more than a full course load and maintaining a full scholarship. It turns out he had enjoyed an enriching social life all along as a by-product of his widespread involvement in and out of class, and is now in a happy, healthy relationship. Save the social aspect, I never had any of those achievements, despite growing up in an achievement-oriented school culture. Strangely, we were never aware of Clinton's activities beyond his everyday coursework and fencing practices.\n",
      "  I realized how wrong we all were to doubt his judgment and assume that his resigned behavior at home must have mirrored his behavior at school. From a strictly utilitarian standpoint, there may indeed be net benefits from choosing the Higgs Boson over friends for pizza. But even if I agreed to this notion during my years at UCC, Clinton’s approach was out of the question simply because it didn’t complement the highly social culture that I had been primed with from my critical age to my coming of age. It likely doesn't complement the norm for the average student anywhere. Yet, I had developed the misconception that Clinton’s behavior at home practically antagonized the spirit of a healthy education that UCC promoted (A Private Universe, 1987), and despite understanding its merits, still labeled his behavior as counter-productive. It still hits me today that while I lived life to the fullest, he made his own life. However, showing outstanding results on paper is enough to kick-off a paradigm shift.\n",

The teacher can then 'teach to the problem' if a student can't understand something on screen, or is getting frustrated.\n",
      "  Also, a lot of these computer games allow students to keep trying for a certain amount of times, or has a time-limit, tries can be useful in allowing students to work things out, time-limits could be problematic or help with mental math skills.  If we could take the data from a computer game identifying which students did which questions and how many tries it took, or who excelled at what, that would be a really interesting leap into diagnostics.  Especially if you can set it to say, review division after you've been teaching that unit.  Maybe it's wishful thinking.\n",

Other than that I think it is pretty much the choice of the teacher as part of planning the unit. I don't think you will necessarily need to teach concepts related to polygons and angles in isolation as there are a lot of interdependencies.\n",

      "  For example, young kids will be able to identify a rectangle when they see one because all the corners are right angles, and there's something inherently \"special\" about right angles that separate the rectangle from other quadrilaterals when you just look at them. Maybe because it's so orderly and predictable and has an air of being the perfect, ideal quadrilateral... They probably won't know that there are 90 degrees in a right angle yet, but I can imagine a kindergarten teacher telling her students that \"a rectangle is a shape with four sides, and all the corners have to look like this\" (*holds arms up perpendicular to each other*), and the students would truly understand perpendicularity.

When the chalk is angled towards the direction of the stroke, the force exerted by the hand is transmitted through the chalk and causes it to dig into the board. Because the chalk and board are very rough on a microscopic level, they experience a large amount of friction, so the chalk temporarily stops moving until the force exerted by the hand is great enough to overpower the opposing frictional force. At this point, the chalk slips, leaves the board, and leaves behind a single \"dotted\" mark. The continued force of the chalkbearer's hand toward the board (as it continues its stroke) soon sends the chalk back into the board and again experiencing a temporary frictional force.

      "Alicia, Tanya, Ed, and Lucas\n",
      "  Our group consulted different resources in order to find material on our topic. Each resource shed light on the specific points and counterpoints we discussed. Below is a short summary from each of our resources.\n",
      "  Point 1:Every child deserves a head start; the earlier children learn, the better.\n",
      "  In the winter of 2011, Kevin Costante, Deputy Minister of Education, interviewed Dr. Fraser Mustard, a Medical Doctor, researcher, and founding president of The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(CIAR).  CIAR is an international collection of people’s research in science and technology, early childhood, economic issues, and determinants of health and human development.  As pointed out in the interview, Dr. Fraser Mustard believes that a child’s capacities for learning and behaviour are “actively developed during early childhood, to the extent that the verbal capacities you find by the age of four…are basically the child’s literacy and verbal capacities for life” (Mustard, 2011. p 4).  This notion supports the Ontario government’s decision to implement a full-day kindergarten program, as this program points to the critical importance of helping children develop cognitively in their early years.  This movement supports the notion that every child deserves a head start and that child cognitive development is not only possible but also necessary.\n",
      "  Counterpoint 1:Academic acceleration is harmful to young students because it takes away from the importance of play-based learning.\n",
      "  The intention of the kindergarten program in Ontario is to provide universal access to early education and to allow for students to be socially and developmentally ready to enter grade one. Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (2001) argues, it is important that the kindergarten program is holistic in nature. Schools should not just focus on academics but integrate play into learning.\n",
      "  Play is a very important instigator in the learning process of young children. Play promotes the understanding of colours, shapes, tastes and sounds. Furthermore, play helps progress literacy skills through words, ideas, and developing concepts. Play can help with the social and emotional progress of a child. Through play children learn about sharing, respect, friendship, competition, cooperation and to connect socially (Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, 2001). All of these life skills are necessary in developing a well-rounded child.\n",
      "  Point 2: Children respond to their environments so we should create environments that promote academic acceleration.\n",
      "  Many educational theorists believe that \"every child deserves a head start\" and that children who are pushed academically at a young age are more likely to succeed throughout their school years. Siegfried and Therese Engelmann (1981) state that \"children respond to the environment...we can take the environment a step further and mold it into a purposeful instrument that teaches and that guarantees your child will have a superior mind (p.10).\" This argument is supported in the article, Meeting the Needs of Young Gifted Students, which states that it is difficult to determine the potential that young students possess (Meader, 1996). It is not in a young child's nature to ask for new challenges; as educators, we must ensure that our teaching practices accommodate needs that vary from the norm and challenge children's interests and understandings (Meader, 1996). By observing each student as a unique individual and offering a range of activities, educators can strive to offer challenging experiences and facilitate the optimal development of each child (Meader, 1996).\n",
      "  Counterpoint 2:If you teach a young student something they are not ready to learn, they may memorize the right answer without necessarily understanding the problem.\n",
      "  The public education in Finland is widely known for starting formal schooling at age seven.  Finland has also consistently scored near the top of all the international test rankings in education across the world (Sax, 2007).  While children have been starting academic schooling later, there has been a push in North America for kindergarten to look more like grade one did thirty years ago: focused on reading and writing, and numeracy (Elkind, 1996).\n",
      "  Developmentally, this is impractical. “Young children's rates of intellectual attainment are quite variable, and it makes little sense to have uniform, standardized kindergarten. Even children with similar intellectual potential may be at very different intellectual levels (Elkind, 1996)”. Trying to teach a student something they are not ready to learn may lead them to adapt how to give the “right” answer even though they will not necessarily understand the problem.  Something as simple as holding a child back a couple of years may actually help them get ahead, as they will be able to learn that same concept faster at another stage of their biological and cognitive development.\n",
      "  The reality in a 21st century kindergarten class where academics is highlighted is that the teachers divide children into two groups: with the teacher are the kids who are ready for paper and pencil reading and writing and then the group of kids who the teacher recognized as not ready to learn to read and write.  With such segregation, kids start to determine very young that they are in the “dumb group” and form negative opinions of school very early (Sax, 2007).\n",

      "8,187,2,An anecdote I thought I'd share relating to today's discussion about the pizza party money theft scenario.\n",
      "  When I was in grade 3, I was a bit of a kleptomaniac and rarely tried to restrain myself from pocketing a few classroom items for no real purpose. It started with chalk and pencils, then escalated to a small box of paper clips (I especially liked the vinyl-coated ones) and plastic rulers. I think at one point I pinched a five-pack of floppy disks.\n",
      "  Did I know I was doing wrong? I don't think it hit me that it was categorically wrong to steal; I was more utilitarian about it. My teacher had drawers full of stationery, so what's one piece of chalk more or less for him? He probably wouldn't even notice, whereas for me the chalk would be a trophy, a prized token, an artifact. It would be treated with dignity! Besides, I couldn't buy my own chalk if I wanted to. The net gains certainly outweighed the losses; it was most definitely a just cause!\n",
      "  Taking from my unsuspecting classmates was trickier to justify, for we were all equals and thus my gain was equal in magnitude to another's loss. Hmm...But what's this? Everyone has a Tamagotchi? Everyone has a mechanical pencil? I was so enthralled that an equal could own something that I've never seen before. These were mysterious items, but at the same time the fact that the transparent Techniclick pencil was just lying there unattended and all alone on the desk next to mine and as real as an HB pencil took away from its mythical quality.\n",
      "  *yoink*\n",
      "  With a mechanical pencil in my backpack, I felt like a super tech-savvy, modern-day wizard. If I can't say \"open sesame\", then at least I could summon lead from a plastic pencil with the press of a button.\n",
      "  The excitement lasted no more than two days.\n",
      "  But how could I return these items to their proper owners? Confessing would be like turning oneself in to police. Dumb idea. Leaving them in the original spots I found them didn't seem quite right either. 1) It'd seem a lot more natural if they were lost forever; my classmates will just assume that they carelessly misplaced them, and they'll forget about it sooner or later. But if I placed back the pencils, they'd think something fishy was going on and their souls would never rest. 2) If my classmates would ultimately be reunited with their belongings, then surely it wouldn't hurt if I held onto them a bit longer, just to maximize my utility. I mean, if I took the trouble to pocket the pencil in the first place, then I might as well make it worth my while!\n",
      "  Several months later, I lost my pencil case, with the mechanical pencils, paper clips, plastic rules, and chalk in it.\n",

      "  Vision of Good Teaching Mind Map—Artist Statement\n",
      "              Admittedly, I approached the aesthetics of this piece rather haphazardly, being guided only by the traits that I associate with ideal teacherhood. These traits were organized under four umbrella ideas: a teacher should 1) inspire his students to find joy and passion in personal growth, 2) have a solid grasp of the knowledge not only in his designated subject area but also in educational issues, 3) love his students unconditionally as being entrusted by other parents with the well-being and dignity of their children, and 4) maintain professionalism in the best and worst of times. These traits make a teacher well-equipped and well-rounded in all aspects of education and school life, and trickle down into the student’s holistic learning experience.\n",
      "              As my mind map unfolded with more extensive branching into the specifics and nuances, a bittersweet notion became more apparent and somewhat more jarring: teachers have among the most humanitarian and most noble professions in the world, but are also among the least appreciated and least prestigious. I was suddenly instilled with the imperative to glorify the teacher as an individual whose essence of sheer inspiration, knowledge, professionalism, and love, radiated in a loose but controlled manner and spilled into the lives of those he or she reaches. Each of the four core aspects is given a colour and a simple “logo” that (remotely) depicts the spirit of that aspect. The green swish symbolizes the elevated, fanciful nature of inspiration, the yellow wave is an icon of harmony and consistency, the blue two-lobed brain represents knowledge, and the red heart top celebrates the nurturing guardian. These aspects originate from the teacher, who is almost deified as streaks of light seem to spill from his body in a star-like pattern. Lastly, two silhouettes are visible in the background, subtly paralleling the sections of the mind map in front.\n",

      "8,217,1,  Student Diversity and Self-Esteem\n",
      "  By: Maria Andriano, Olivia Gerardi, Carly Guglielmin, and Alessandro Mazza\n",
      "              One aspect of student diversity includes the issue of self-esteem. As mentioned in the point/counterpoint discussion, some people view the self-esteem movement as having problems, causing negative impact on students. Dr. Dona Matthews explains that self-esteem can be classified under a fixed mindset explanation (Dr. Dona Matthews, Conference, November 22nd, 2011). This means that, “some children are categorized as inherently smart and some are not. The fixed mindset is associated with lower achievement and self esteem” (Dr. Dona Matthews, Conference, November 22nd, 2011). Students who have high self-esteem may be hesitant in accepting constructive criticism, impacting them in further excelling in their academic studies.\n",
      "            Contrary to this belief, the self-esteem movement has shown promise, but it may be more appropriate to change the words “self-esteem” to “self-efficacy”. Promoting self-efficacy may prove more meaningful since he or she would be encouraging students to believe in their abilities. Promoting self-esteem praises the person rather than the capabilities of the student (Seonaid Davis, Personal Communication, November 2011).\n",
      "            Another aspect of student diversity includes the idea that students have different multiple intelligences (MI). Conventionally, “intelligence” has been thought of as a single broad ability that allows a person to complete different kinds of tasks (Seifert, 2008). With this view, students are either intelligent or unintelligent. Gardner’s Theory of MI presents an alternate view which states that intelligence comes in many forms (Campbell & Campbell, 1999). Teachers and entire schools have implemented Gardner’s Theory of MI, making it the basis of their curriculums (Campbell, 1995). Incorporating MI theory in instruction allows teachers to diversify instruction, thereby responding to student diversity, which in turn increases self-esteem. Therefore, MI theory positively influences teacher beliefs about intelligence, instruction, and student achievement (Campbell, 1995).\n",
      "            The multiple intelligence theory, however, is not as clear as it is presented to us in books. Kristen Nicholson-Nelson (1998) points out that, “in reality, educating young children means recognizing that each of them is unique, complex, and highly individualistic” (4). Children should be seen holistically, and not just categorized into one specific type of intelligence. As she suggests, “their overall intelligence is based on the sum of all of their intelligences” (4). One multiple intelligence cannot be used without the other.\n",
      "            If teachers are not careful, they can begin to categorize students, creating a stigmatism. After some time, students may appear confident in one area of intelligence, but lack self esteem in the other areas. Since most activities in the classroom, and even in the workforce, do not rely solely on one specific type of intelligence, this categorization may become problematic for many students who have been given a label, or a stigmatism.\n",
      "            The idea of gender is another component of student diversity. Many people argue that boys and girls learn the same since several parameters outside of gender explain why students learn differently. Why must gender be the sole explanation for why students perform different academically? According to Eliot (2010), gender is a poor predictor of any individual student performance, and this is why considering other factors such as age, race and ethnicity is suggested. Eliot (2010) discusses how boys’ and girls’ brains are relatively the same. In other words, these few differences cannot be held accountable for gender diversity. It is more accurate to say that ALL students learn differently regardless of gender. Boys or girls are more diverse in their own gender compared to the difference between boys and girls (Eliot, 2010). Identifying students interests based on gender confirms the media’s stereotypical images associated with boys and girls. As a result, single-sex schools confirm these stereotypes and shelter students from real-life scenarios where males and females coincide (Chan, 2011).\n",
      "            On the contrary, some argue that boys and girls learn differently. Other sources state that women’s brains are physically different in comparison to those of men (Eliot, 2010). Evidently, this explains why male and female students have varying interests. Timing of the development of gross motor skills differs towards the end of elementary education (Seifert, 2008). Consequently, teachers may have preconceived notions, which in turn affect the way students perform, their learning, and their self-esteem (Campbell & Campbell, 1999). Girls experience an academic transition during their school years. Female students, though more motivated initially, “may try to down play their own academic ability in order to make themselves more likeable by both sexes” (Seifert, 2008, 63). Ultimately, this supports the notion that single-sex schools are beneficial and important when it comes to student learning and development. For example, TDSB discusses the pros and cons of implementing single-sex schools within the public sector (Chan, 2011). Whether this is a good idea or not is up for debate!\n",

      "8,219,1,The class would organize themselves by their birthday (Jan - Dec) in order without speaking. Therefore they must use hand gestures and body language to organize themselves. Everyday the questions/activity could change.,\n",
      "8,220,1,   As an interpersonal energizer, we suggest a U-shaped discussion - on any topic, like food or music or current events. In sorting themselves along the line, they fully articulate themselves in relation to each other and further define their own opinions (so it's necessarily intrapersonal too).\n",
      "     Other ideas: On the Bus and Lifeboats (organizing themselves into groups based on a given theme, like birth season or favourite music).,\n",
      "8,221,1,This energizer involves \"making it rain\" with your class.  Divide the class into four sections based on the sound they will be making: rubbing their hands together, snapping, tapping their desks, stomping their feet.  Start with the sound of hands rubbing, and gradually add in snapping, tapping and stomping one at a time.  Then, to make the rain stop, have the students stop each sound in reverse order: stomping, tapping, snapping, rubbing their hands. ,\n",
      "8,222,1,Can use a 2-minute mystery, a la Encyclopedia Brown, or short riddle to challenge logic/reasoning skills.  Example:\n",
      "  Imagine you are standing at a point on the planet.  You walk 4 kilometres south, then 4 kilometres west, followed by 4 kilometres north, and you end up in the same place where you started.  Where are you?  (Added variation: what colour is the bear?)\n",
      "  Answer: Either North Pole or anywhere along the line where the circumference of the earth is 4km.  And the bear, if you're in the North Pole, is white.,\n",

      "  Just wanted to share a flash widget that I imagine would be fun (and potentially addictive) for kids to play around with as a music energizer. No technical musical knowledge is required, since the pitches are chosen so that whatever combination you choose, it won't sound dissonant. This would be easier to pull off in a computer lab...\n",
      "  Just an idea: give students an abstract topic like rain, and give them 3 minutes to compose something that they consider to evoke rain. Then have several of them play their riffs and ask what common elements did they hear when listening to each other's work (e.g. chords vs. single notes, fast notes vs. quarter notes, etc.).\n",
      "  Even more ambitious for slightly older students: after doing that exercise, you could also have Audacity installed on each computer, then have each student record their composition as an mp3. Then the teacher will collect the mp3s and combine all the riffs together into a seamless track. Maybe that could be showcased at a school assembly as a mini classwide project.,\n",
      "8,224,2,Our group decided on two linguistic energizers.\n",
      "1) Provide students with a long word (i.e. dictionary). The word could be a particular concept being taught or an overarching theme in an unit plan. In a two minute time span, students are expected to decipher as many smaller words as they can think of.\n",
      "  2) Provide students with a brief scenario (i.e. hightlights of your summer vacation). Students write as much as they can in two minutes without stopping. Encourage students to write what comes to mind initiallly rather then ``stop to think``. Have students share their responses.\n",

I wouldn't use this video as a teaching tool per se, but maybe more as an exposure tool to show students how mathematics is the basis for a lot of musical concepts like structure or phrasing (e.g. 4 beats to a bar, 4 bars to a phrase, how adding certain syncopated sounds creates a certain \"groove\" in a beat or riff, etc.). Students can see how the timing of the notes (unlike on a staff) literally correspond with their spatial position on a sequencer. i.e. If the notes are equally spaced on the screen, you'll hear them at equally spaced time intervals. Furthermore, if you have Audacity, you could show the effects of cutting out sections of music from the original; if you remove, say, 5 or 9 beats, students would get \"thrown off\", whereas if you remove 8 beats, no one would notice.\n",

      "8,246,1,  In Chapter 6: Student Motivation, Seifert (2011) lays out numerous theories of motivation.  When a behavioural model was increasingly viewed as too limiting to accurately account for the various facets of motivation, various cognitive theories were developed.\n",
      "  “Motivational Behaviour – A GIEDE” can serve as a method to remember the 7 main theories:\n",
      "Motivation As: Behaviour Change; Attribution; Goals; Interest; Self-Efficacy; Self-Determination; and Expectancy-x-Value.\n",
      "  In each of the cognitive models, intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation are important underlying concepts which are either dealt with directly or have important consequences for the motivation being discussed.  Overall, the TARGET model (Task-Authority-Recognition-Grouping-Evaluating-Time) provides for an integration of most of the concepts touched upon by the above models (Seifert, 2011).\n",
      "  Behaviour change looks at how motivation can be influenced by observable behavior.  For example, positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement look at how adding stimuli can trigger behaviour change.  Attributions look at the reasons for why students get motivated.  The reasons include the source of the attribute, whether the attribute is controlled, and how constant the attribute is. Motivation as goals looks at how one’s goals can influence motivation.  Students with a “mastery” goal for knowledge or skills are more likely to remain motivated than students whose interest is focused on performing according to an external standard, whether that is to standard or simply avoiding failing that standard.  Students are also motivated by their level of interest.  Interest can be short or long term, situational or personal.  Motivation as self-efficacy looks at how students will become motivated based on whether they believe that they can accomplish the task.  Motivation as self-determination is focused on choices and whether students have the ability to determine their choices. Lastly, student motivation can be related to whether or not they expect to succeed in completing a task compared to its relative value.  TARGET integrates the above and takes into consideration the task, autonomy of student, recognition, grouping, evaluation, and time, for a holistic view of motivation (Seifert, 2011).\n",
      "  Some teachers believe that adding fun activities to course content can help engage students in learning material.  However, the research in this area is inconclusive, indicating that not only does “fun” not always help, sometimes it can actually hinder learning.\n",
      "  It can be helpful to engage students by adding games, challenges, and tasks into the lesson to promote student involvement.  Students gain a sense of ownership in specific tasks, leading participants to develop an intrinsic motivation to win/participate (Moss, 2000).  Fun activities in the classroom can help students remember difficult concepts, as they can relate the activity to the material.  As Guthrie & Alao (1997) study indicated, students were more likely to read more when they became interested in the material.\n",
      "  Furthermore, when students participate in fun activities, they can work together and use critical thinking in order to solve/navigate a particular task or puzzle (Matthews & Lowe, 2011).  Critical thinking is used to engage students in their learning.  By presenting students with scenarios or specific tasks, not only are these activities fun for students but they will promote students to practice and develop both their critical thinking and problem solving skills (Matthews, & Lowe, 2011).\n",
      "  Conversely, fun activities can be a deterrent toward learning if the fun activity is irrelevant to the learning goal. A topic will remain the same even if fun activities are added to it rather than integrated as part of the material (Dewey, 1913) When fun activities are added to topics to make them more interesting, research has shown that students were less able to remember the learning goals than the control group, despite their significant recall of the extraneous “fun” detail (Harp, & Mayer, 1993).  Furthermore, when required to take those learning goal facts and transfer them into required procedures, the learning that had taken place did not easily transfer (Dillon, Martin, McCaughtry & Shen, 2006).\n",
      "  The issue of whether or not “fun” should be integrated into learning ties most closely to the “interest” model of motivation, and the attempt to move the student from a position of “no” or “low” interest, to “situational” interest, to “personal” interest.  Although can add fun activities to engage student learning and increase motivation, it is important to remember that it is only situational and that it is important to analyze whether the activities are truly logically related to the material being conveyed.\n",

      "8,270,1,  Should Schools Teach Critical Thinking and Problem Solving?\n",
      "Chapter 9: Facilitating Complex Thinking\n",
      "By: Heather, Shira and Michelle\n",
      "              Having consulted numerous resources, we discovered a wealth of information that both supports and opposes the teaching and integration of critical thinking in schools.\n",
      "            According to Edward de Bono’s Cognitive Research Trust program (CoRT), critical thinking and problem-solving allows students to become independent thinkers who are able to make judgments on their own. A critical thinker is able to ask relevant questions, evaluate evidence for ideas, reason through problems both logically and objectively, as well as express ideas coherently and precisely. These skills are transferable not only to other classrooms but to the real world. After all, the classroom is a microcosm of society. With the confidence to think and the ability to focus on a situation or given context from a variety of angles, students who are critical thinkers contribute to society and feel that their contribution is valid (de Bono, 2012).\n",
      "            Pressley’s Good Strategy User Model mirrors the benefits of critical thinking that CoRT promotes. Pressley believes problem-solving strategies enhance comprehension and help students overcome past comprehension failures (Pressley, 1989). Similarly, the Reciprocal Teaching approach by Palinscar and Brown (1984), advocates for direct teaching of metacognitive skills through comprehension fostering and comprehension monitoring activities. Through activities and practices, such as Reciprocal Teaching and the Good Strategy User model, students become confident in and capable of taking on leadership roles in the classroom.  They also develop their own ideas and thought processes, extract pertinent information from given texts and monitor their own comprehension and progress as a learner.\n",
      "            Students who learn through discovery think for themselves, acquire information independently and gain powerful intellectual skills that will prove to be invaluable in all facets of life (Papert, 1980).\n",
      "            Contrary to the aforementioned benefits of teaching critical thinking and problem-solving in schools, experts are not convinced that those skills transfer to new and varying contexts.  E. D. Hirsch, a well-known critic of thinking programs such as CoRT, feels there is no adequate or substantial proof for the effectiveness of such programs. Rather than fostering skills and strategies for thinking, Hirsch believes that focusing on content is far more valuable than on process. He believes that if students do not have a broad knowledge base their comprehension will not improve and vocabulary gaps will remain problematic for many students, as the gaps in their learning can only be remedied by honing in on content itself (Hirsch, 2006).\n",
      "            Similar to Hirch, Siegler (1993) raises caution that teaching direct metacognitive skills hinders student learning rather than helps it.  Siegler highlights that if students are distracted by the strategy they are supposed to be implementing and solely focused on mastering it (as their teachers may encourage), they may be less focused on the content itself.  As a result, students may not process the necessarily information from the lesson and find little benefit from the lesson.\n",
      "            Chapter 9 in our course textbook articulates and represents the way we personally feel we would approach the issue of critical thinking and problem solving in schools. As the approaches in instructional strategies are numerous, and even more are being developed and introduced, we feel that we gained a tremendous amount from researching this point and counterpoint and from the opportunity to share it with our classmates. We realize that deciding which strategies to employ and when to implement them is in our hands, and we hope to find a truly balanced approach that appropriately suites the needs of our students, the demands of society, and the outlines of curriculum.\n",

The argument against brain-based education contends that its implications are not clear, and thus it is not advisable to use such techniques. However, this is a loaded statement and we must evaluate it in multiple steps.\n",
      "  Misapplication\n",
      "One reason the implications of brain-based education may be unclear is that inappropriate methodologies are currently in use. Alferink and Farmer-Dougan (2010) examine brain-based education across several settings, focusing on special education in particular. They point to left-brain/right-brain based curricula as an example of inappropriate technique, stating that the two hemispheres work simultaneously and thus, \"hemisphere-specific instruction is not a method for improving neocortical processing\" (Alferink & Farmer-Dougan, pg. 44). While this is a legitimate stance against lateralized instruction, it falls flat as an argument against brain-based education on the whole, since we do not intend to base our teaching on flawed or outdated science.\n",
      "  Responding to the research\n",
      "OISE would not have a course on child and adolescent development if the brain were not extremely important in our teaching. As educators, we will be providing the stimuli for thirty brains a day, for several hours at a time. Thus, our task as researchers and educators is to parse the research effectively, choosing and testing the procedures that will yield the most benefits in our practice. We must develop a working understanding of cognitive mechanisms in order to evaluate our options.\n",
      "  To that end, our group has prepared a brief primer on relevant neurological processes, with an eye to the adolescent brain in particular, and a few research-supported techniques for improving memory formation and retention in our students.\n",
      "  Practical information about the brain\n",
      "Memory formation depends on the interconnectedness of brain cells (neurons), which connect to other neurons via their nerve fibres (axons). The more often neurons communicate with each other, the more closely related their patterns of activation are; that is, when one neuron fires, it becomes significantly more likely that the other related neuron will fire. A memory is formed when a network of axons becomes strengthened in this manner. This is known as long term potentiation (LTP). It is essential to understand LTP because it is how learning takes place. It is also the means by which short-term memories are encoded into long-term memory.\n",
      "  As educators, our primary objective is to have students create new networks of memories, or link different memories together; as such, it is beneficial to know how the brain works.\n",
      "  Also crucial to memory is a component of the brain called the hippocampus. The axons in this area of the brain have a important job, which can be likened to indexing memories. Neurons send signals to the hippocampus to locate a repertoire of information elsewhere in the brain. The more LTP occurs, the easier it is to access that information via the hippocampus, and solidify that connection. This is the biological basis of learning.\n",
      "  Links to adolescence\n",
      "The adolescent brain is undergoing a complex variety of transformations, making their actions, emotions, and decisions difficult to comprehend. Traditional studies justify the uncertainties of the teenage brain with the notion that the brain is no longer in a critical period of development. This means that learning and decision-making becomes more difficult with age. This theory has been challenged with the concept of plasticity, which refers to the power of the brain to change as a result of input from the environment. The human brain has been proven to remain plastic well into stages of adulthood (Understanding the Brain, 2007).\n",
      "  During adolescence, individuals are able to create more intricate thoughts, however, they may suffer from poor decision-making due to limited emotional development. Neuroscientists compare the teenage brain to a sports car as the brain has “high horsepower” with “poor steering” (Understanding the Brain, 2007). A teenage brain generally has an underdeveloped pre-frontal cortex. This area of the brain is associated with behaviours, expression and decision-making. Additionally, adolescents tend to have an immature cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for muscle coordination and the process of thinking (PBS). As teenagers are generally targeted for being rebellious, troublesome, and at times apathetic; these studies have proved that these labels are due to stages of brain development.\n",
      "  Selected classroom techniques (C-H-A-R-M)\n",
      "Chunking with graphic organizers: As the human brain can only hold 7± 2 discrete pieces of information (Miller, 1956, cited in Wolfe, 2001), our job as educators relies on our ability to 'chunk,' or sort, information into manageable, meaningful chunks. One way of doing this is to provide graphic organizers for students, to make sense of the information we introduce.\n",
      "  Healthy amounts of stress: Students who experience high amounts of stress will experience disruptions in brain cell development (Willis, 2006). It is incumbent on us to create a low-stress environment for our students, and to that end, Willis suggests the following: support and understand teens through their mood swings, give them opportunities to be honoured for their individuality, build confidence by building community and connectedness. On the other hand, manageable stress can be beneficial to memory, which biologically supports the practice of Minds-On activities involving surprise, humour, etc.\n",
      "  Association: Information without context is forgotten rapidly (Ebbinghaus, as cited in Wolfe, 2001). By connecting new concepts to familiar experiences, the corresponding neuronal connections increase in strength and complexity, and this process is directly implicated in memory retention.\n",
      "  Rehearsal: In some contexts, so-called \"skill and drill\" techniques are appropriate. Wolfe (2001) refers to Bloom's notion of \"automaticity\" (pg. 102) as a state reached only after repeated rote rehearsal. Performance in areas such as the arts, sport, mathematics or carpentry, improves with automaticity: in these areas, students might benefit from more traditional teaching techniques.\n",
      "  Multimodality: Alferink and Farmer-Dougan encourage incorporating a broad range of instructional techniques into our repertoires, even in the case of a known ability or preference within one learning style, saying \"[t]he larger the child's inventory of learning strategies, the more likely the child is to learn across environmental settings\" (Alferink and Farmer-Dougan, 2010). Perhaps it goes without saying that a diversity of tactics would yield robust learning experiences, but it is comforting to know that the research supports our intuition in this matter.\n",

      "    Concerns:\n",
      "-Not all courses have electronic materials (e.g. newspaper clippings). One potential answer to this would be a photocopier (for those not too adept with tricky scanners) that would digitize the materials into a downloadable pdf.\n",

      "CONs to Parental Involvement:\n",
      "  1. Parent as taskmaster\n",
      "Having parents involved with and accountable for homework completion in the home can strain the parent-child relationship, one that may already have it's own tensions.\n",
      "More than 1/3 of 5th graders say: \"get tense working with their parents on homework\". (Epstein, 1983)\n",
      "Half of 1,200 parents of K-12 children reported that they have had a serious fight with their children in the past year that involved yelling or crying. (1999, Public Agenda)\n",
      "2. Burden on parents\n",
      "Parents often have at least one job, in addition to household and familiy responsibilities. It is unfair to add \"homework-helper\" to their list as well. Sometimes, homework requirements can be unreasonable (example from class), and can be hard for parents to manage.\n",

      "Unreasonable Homework Requirements (Bennett, 2006)\n",
      "3. Conflicts with Family Time\n",
      "Homework can conflict with family time in the home. Sometimes this family time is limited due to complex family situations\n",
      "Complex family situations. E.g. Single working parent, divorced parents, no parents.  (Bennet, 2006)\n",
      "4. Parents “helping” with homework\n",
      "For many reasons, parents will often just complete the homework for their children becuase there is too much, or because they think that the homework is not a fruitful use of time.\n",
      " “My daughter takes a half hour for dinner and during this time she often [completes some of her school work]. Sometimes she works until she falls asleep at her desk. I will then look over her work to see what needs to be completed and I will complete it for her. There are times when the assignment is so inane or so “busy-work” that in order to relieve the stress that this may cause, it has been necessary to do the work for her just to get it out of our faces” Mother of two and an elementary school principal from suburban NY (Bennett, 2006)\n",
      "      Should assigning homework be the default practice?\n",

      "- more for secondary student  (Cooper & Valentine, 2001)\n",
      "- physical and mental health (Gill & Schlossman, 2004; American Child Health Association, 1930; Cooper & Valentine, 2001)\n",
      "  2. Skills and Habits\n",

      "Counterpoint\n",
      "- parental involvement can turn to parental interference (Cooper & Valentine, 2004)\n",
      "Alfie Kohn's View of Homework\n",
      "\"No Homework\" shoudl be the default rather than the exception.\n",
      "Teachers need to think of a good reason to opt in. Questions to ask:\n",
      "Will the assignment be beneficial to most of them?\n",
      "How will the assignment impact their interest in learning and in the topic at hand?\n",
      "Design what you assign - This is likely to reduce quantity and improve quality of homework.\n",
      "Kohn's Examples of \"Good\" homework:\n",
      "  1) Activities that are naturally suited to the home\n",
      "Examples:\n",
      "Interview family members on family history,\n",
      "Ask a family member how they learned a math concept in their time and than explain them how we learn it nowadays\n",
      "Design your own experiment at the home kitchen that will replicate/extend results from a class experiment.\n",
      "2) Family activities we don't normally consider homework (\"home learning\")\n",
      "\"spending time in the company of grown-ups\" - crossword puzzles, word or card games, reading out loud, cooking,\n",
      "Optional - written reflection on the experiences.\n",
      "  3) Reading\n",
      "Sustained reading of REAL BOOKS (not chunks of prose devoid of context) helps children become more proficient readers.\n",
      "- own choosing\n",
      "- no mandatory minimum #pages or #minutes (parents of young children may be informed about recommended guidelines, but students should not feel forced to achieve a certain minimum)\n",
      "- opportunity to talk with classmates about reading.\n",
      "  Choice\n",
      "- involve students in decisions regarding assignments rather than telling them what they will have to do.\n",
      "- In one research \"star\" teachers did not give homework in traditional sense (p 59 from textbook) - instead they provided assignments that were planned with the children and grow out of some class activity.\n",
      "- discuss with students not only the when, how or which, but also the whether.\n",
      "  Anecdotal examples from schools and classes  that cancelled traditional homework show that students enjoy the open-ended nature of the assignments and gain a sense of ownership that promotes meaningful learning.\n",
      "  Kino School, Tucson Arizona, abolished regular homework.\n",
      "\"Our goal as educators is to make learning interesting enough that students often want to continue with a project in the evening\"\n",
      "  A Grade 3 teacher that eliminated all homework except reading own choice books has many students invent and complete their own academic projects. \"parents report that they have never seen their child so positive about school\".\n",
      "    Kohn's reason why homework should not be a default practice:\n",
      "1) Less interest in learning\n",
      "Homework has adverse impact on intellectual curiosity and there is a risk that students may generalise it to school itself.\n",
      "(\"The most important attitude that can be formed is that of desire to go on learning\" - John Dewey)\n",
      "    2) Burden on parents  - many parents resent the implicit expectations that they become homework monitors and helpers after a long day at their jobs. Moreover, many homework assignments contain instructions that are difficult for even highly educated parents to understand.\n",
      "  3) Stress for children.\n",
      "  4) Family conflict - parent child relationship is already complex without giving parents a new role as a teacher/enforcer. In addition, homework are taking time away from  potential constructive relaxed family activities that could improve this relationship.\n",
      "  5) Less time for other activities - reading for pleasure, exercising, socializing, volunteering, spending time with parents, and other kinds on non-academic learning.\n",
      "    Kohn's reason why existing research on homework (claiming it improves achievement) is flawed:\n",
      "  1) At best studies show association, not causation.\n",
      "Cooper himself concedes that \"it is equally plausible\" that teachers assign more homework to students who are achieving better... or that better students simply spend more time on home study\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, when comparing achievements in 2 schools - one that gives more homework and one that gives less homework, we may be ignoring the fact that one school may be in a more affluent neighbourhood where parents can afford extra tutoring or parents themselves are more educated and can help their children better.\n",
      "  Several studies have even found NEGATIVE relationship between time spent on homework and achievements.\n",
      "  2) Research is over-dependent on self-reporting (by teachers, students, parents) leading to very inaccurate/inconclusive results.\n",
      "  3) Even when they do exist, positive effects are very small and do not justify the extra effort by students and teachers (by Kohn's analysis the benefit amounts to about 4% increase).\n",
      "  4) No evidence of homework's academic benefits in lower grades. Kohn criticises the recent increase of homework in lower elementary grades in the US, supposedly to \"raise standards\" even though there is no evidence that it provides any benefit\n",
      "    5) There is NO EMPIRICAL DATA to support the claims made by some researchers that homework builds character or work habits such as  \"initiative/responsibility\".\n",
      "  The vast majority of research focuses on grades/test results.\n",
      "  6) Even in the absence of research data, the myth of \"homework promotes responsibility and independence\" is pervasive. Let's rethink the logic: kids almost never get a chance to decide whether to have homework or not, or when to do it. One mother commented that homework assignments are really testing her proficiency at time management, not the kid's.\n",

      "8,372,2,  Should Parents be Involved in the Homework Process at Home?\n",
      "  PROs to Parental Involvement:\n",
      "  1. Scaffolding learning for the students\n",
      "Homework and the ability to work independently is an important skill that can be helped along by the task of doing homework. The process of learning this can be scaffolded by parents.\n",
      "Physical spaces to do homework\n",
      "Turn off tv in order to avoid distractions\n",
      "Time Managment\n",
      "(Walker, 2004)\n",
      "2. Engage with homework tasks with the student\n",
      "When parents are involved in the homework process, this is a sign to students that what they are learning at school is important.\n",
      "The TIPS Program: “TIPS activities keep school on the agenda at home so that children know that their families believe schoolwork is important and worth talking about.” (http://www.csos.jhu.edu/p2000/tips/index.htm)\n",
      "  3. Gives parents access to the student’s learning\n",
      "By being involved in homework, parents have access to what and how their children are learning in school.\n",
      "“I feel that my child and I have benefited from TIPS math sheets because it has given me a better opportunity to follow what he is learning in math”. – TIPS Parent (Van Voorhis, 2011)\n",
      "CONs to Parental Involvement:\n",
      "  1. Parent as taskmaster\n",
      "Having parents involved with and accountable for homework completion in the home can strain the parent-child relationship, one that may already have it's own tensions.\n",
      "More than 1/3 of 5th graders say: \"get tense working with their parents on homework\". (Epstein, 1983)\n",
      "Half of 1,200 parents of K-12 children reported that they have had a serious fight with their children in the past year that involved yelling or crying. (1999, Public Agenda)\n",
      "2. Burden on parents\n",
      "Parents often have at least one job, in addition to household and familiy responsibilities. It is unfair to add \"homework-helper\" to their list as well. Sometimes, homework requirements can be unreasonable (example from class), and can be hard for parents to manage.\n",
      "Re-learning vocabulary and concepts in order to help students with their work.\n",
      "Unreasonable Homework Requirements (Bennett, 2006)\n",
      "3. Conflicts with Family Time\n",
      "Homework can conflict with family time in the home. Sometimes this family time is limited due to complex family situations\n",
      "Complex family situations. E.g. Single working parent, divorced parents, no parents.  (Bennet, 2006)\n",
      "4. Parents “helping” with homework\n",
      "For many reasons, parents will often just complete the homework for their children becuase there is too much, or because they think that the homework is not a fruitful use of time.\n",
      " “My daughter takes a half hour for dinner and during this time she often [completes some of her school work]. Sometimes she works until she falls asleep at her desk. I will then look over her work to see what needs to be completed and I will complete it for her. There are times when the assignment is so inane or so “busy-work” that in order to relieve the stress that this may cause, it has been necessary to do the work for her just to get it out of our faces” Mother of two and an elementary school principal from suburban NY (Bennett, 2006)\n",
      "      Should assigning homework be the default practice?\n",
      "There are four main issues to look at here:\n",
      "1. Academic Performance\n",
      "Point\n",
      "- positively influences student achievement (US Department of Education, 1986; Goldstein, 1960; Cooper & Valentine, 2001; Gill & Schlossman, 2004)\n",
      "- retention and understanding (Cooper & Valentine, 2001)\n",
      "- extra study time (Cooper & Valentine, 2001)\n",
      "Counterpoint\n",
      "- negatively influences student achievement (Kohn, 2006)\n",
      "causation vs correlation\n",
      "- more for secondary student  (Cooper & Valentine, 2001)\n",
      "- physical and mental health (Gill & Schlossman, 2004; American Child Health Association, 1930; Cooper & Valentine, 2001)\n",
      "  2. Skills and Habits\n",
      "Point\n",
      "- study skills and work habits (Cooper & Valentine, 2001)\n",
      "- self-regulatory practices (Zimmerman & Ramdass, 2011)\n",
      "- goal setting, homework completion strategies\n",
      "- time management\n",
      "- delay of gratification, inhibiting distractions\n",
      "- self-motivation\n",
      "- self-reflection\n",
      "- future employment (Corno & Xu, 2004)\n",
      "Counterpoint\n",
      "- education needs to change (Sir Ken Robinson, 2010)\n",
      "- employers want the four C's (The Partnership for 21st Century Skills)\n",
      "            - creativity\n",
      "            - clear communication\n",
      "            - collaborative\n",
      "            - critical thinking\n",
      "  3. Character Traits\n",
      "Point\n",
      "- independence (Cooper & Valentine, 2004; Gill & Schlossman, 2004)\n",
      "- responsibility (Cooper & Valentine, 2004; Corno & Xu, 2004; Gill & Schlossman, 2004)\n",
      "- attitude toward school (Cooper & Valentine, 2004)\n",
      "Counterpoint\n",
      "- no empirical data; worse attitude toward school (Kohn, 2006)\n",
      "- bad character traits, eg. - cheating (Cooper & Valentine, 2004)\n",
      "- less leisure time and valuable community activities (Cooper & Valentine, 2004; American Child Healther Association, 1930; Gill & Schlossman, 2004)\n",
      "  4. Parents\n",
      "Point\n",
      "- parents favour homework (National PTA, Gill & Schlossman, 2004)\n",
      "- benefits of parental involvement (National PTA, Van Voorhis, 2011)\n",
      "Counterpoint\n",
      "- parental involvement can turn to parental interference (Cooper & Valentine, 2004)\n",
      "    What Type of Homework Should we Assign?\n",
      "Cooper :\n",
      "- Research suggests that longer assignments have no added effectiveness in mathematics\n",
      "- Distributed (review+preparation) content was found to be more effective than same day only content\n",
      "- Voluntary vs. compulsory - virtually no research on the topic.\n",
      "- Individualized assignments or whole class assignments?\n",
      "Ability based individualization did not produce consistently better results than whole class assignments.\n",
      "Individualization based on students' learning style may improve student achievement, attitude and conduct.\n",
      "Kohn:\n",
      "\"No Homework\" shoudl be the default rather than the exception.\n",
      "Teachers need to think of a good reason to opt in. Questions to ask:\n",
      "Will the assignment be beneficial to most of them?\n",
      "How will the assignment impact their interest in learning and in the topic at hand?\n",
      "Provide real choice to the students - discuss with them not only the what, the when, and the how, but also the whether.\n",
      "Design what you assign - This is likely to reduce quantity and improve quality of homework.\n",
      "Kohn's Examples of \"Good\" homework:\n",
      "  1) Activities that are naturally suited to the home\n",
      "Examples:\n",
      "Interview family members on family history,\n",
      "Ask a family member how they learned a math concept in their time and than explain them how we learn it nowadays\n",
      "Design your own experiment at the home kitchen that will replicate/extend results from a class experiment.\n",
      "2) Family activities we don't normally consider homework (\"home learning\")\n",
      "\"spending time in the company of grown-ups\" - crossword puzzles, word or card games, reading out loud, cooking,\n",
      "Optional - written reflection on the experiences.\n",
      "  3) Reading\n",
      "Sustained reading of REAL BOOKS (not chunks of prose devoid of context) helps children become more proficient readers.\n",
      "- own choosing\n",
      "- no mandatory minimum #pages or #minutes (parents of young children may be informed about recommended guidelines, but students should not feel forced to achieve a certain minimum)\n",
      "- opportunity to talk with classmates about reading.\n",

      "  Girls' education is a high priority in international development policy. The discursive framing of girls' education, however, limits the potential for fully achieving gender equity. This study analyzes 300 policy documents from 14 agencies from 1995 to 2008, reports on their discursive arguments for educating girls, and examines the conceptualizations and assumptions embedded in policy. We show that the robustness of \"gender\", and related concepts are limited, thereby limiting the potential of the education that is intended to be gender equitable. Policy remains focused on girls and not gender (or boys), and on easily measurable indicators (counting boys and girls in school) and not social processes that maintain gender inequities. Because the discursive framing of policy influences how policy makers understand the issues, how practitioners implement policy, and how progress is assessed, we call for a richer notion of gender in framing educational policy.,\n",

      "8,413,1,  In the video, The Concept of Fairness, it is explained that fairness does not mean everyone get \"the same\", but what he or she needs. This notion of fairness requires the person a certain level of subjectivity. That being said, how could an educator ensure that their decisions truly reflect fairness? How could one be certain that their efforts to be fair do not create unequitable inequalities?\n",
      "     ,\n",
      "8,414,1,I agree with the notion of fairness video. Some students need certain accomodations that the rest of the class does not need. Teachers need to provide these accmodations to ensure fairness. While I understand this concept, how do we go about this in commucation with our students? When another student complains that the accomodation he sees his friend getting is \"not fair\" how do we react? For example, student X recieves extra time to complete his math test. Student Y claims he too could benefit from that extra time and he feels this situation is unfair. How does fairness get adressed in the classroom in a way that doesnt single out or expose students who need accomodations?,\n",
      "8,416,1,Hey Shira,\n",
      "  I agree with the video and your sentiments. Treating students equitably to support each individual student's learning can be a challenging task. One of the challenges that can arise from fairness is addressing student differences with the class. I believe that a classroom founded on community values of respect, support, and love of learning are essential to an equitable learning environment. I think that the teacher should discuss with the class that every one of us comes from different backgrounds, families, cultures, religions, personal experiences, and educational experiences. The students should be made aware that as a teacher, you will be doing everything you can to help support every student reach their full potential and that the school experience will not be the same for everyone. With this understanding, I would hope that students will be sensitive to their peers and everyone's own unique learning needs. ,\n",
      "8,417,1,  I really love this topic (ehem - my MTRP- ehem), so I like to think that i have some ideas of how we could achieve this. Most importantly, as teachers we have to have open communication with our students on the topic of \"being different\"- meaning, no two students are alike in the way they learn. One suggestion would be to draw parallels that may make more sense to students, perhaps, that some people need glasses, others do not, and while *everyone* can always benefit from extra time, not everyone *needs* the extra time. I believe in the importance of integrating our students into the classroom as seamlessly as possible. So, if there is an accomodation that can be implimented to the entire class, without the whole class realizing that the sole purpose of the accomodation is for one certain student in particular, then everyone can slightly benefit while the student who needs it is granted that boost. Also, we need to be extrememly organized so if we have students that we know work at eccelerated rates we have work available, and for those who are slower, we prepare work at the same level just less to complete. These are of course some things i have been thinking of over the passed little while, and while i know i may not be right, the one thing that i know we can all agree upon if that equity in the classroom is essential, but singling out students as being different can be detrimental so we must be mindful of how we go about doing so.\n",
      "  The Notion of Fairness video is extremely relevant and highlights the importance of not treating every student the same way, rather, treating every student how he or she needs to be treated in order to better set them on the path to their successes- after all, even success criteria varies! Students need to understand the real meaning fair, and one of the best ways to achieve that is simply having that discussion right in the beginning.,\n",

My question is: let's say that student x has a learning disability and requires extra time for a math test. However, student x does not want the extra time because \"x\" feels that he/she would be treated differently. As a teacher, how should one react and respond to a request knowing that the extra time would greatly benefit the student? Would it be fair to student x to isolate him/her from ones peers?,\n",

I work as a special education assistant, and many times other students in the classroom will become very angry when they notice something \"unfair\" with regards to the special need child that I am working with. I have had to write out notes for a deaf/blind student, and other students thought it was \"unfair.\" Sometimes I have behavioral students with a behavior plan. The teacher will give them certain 'rewards\" if they follow a list of approprite behaviors. (Eg. The student will get 5 minutes of computer time if she raises her hand and doesn't hit anybody). I have had other students come over and explain how it is not fair that that student gets computer time while the other don't.\n",

I assume it would depend on what the behavior problem is, and if they were actually identified, etc etc. This is an area of concern for me.

      "Levine describes \"aha\" moments that his patients experience when engaging in open and honest conversations about their own gaps and strengths. Should teachers intergrate such open conversations with students to their instructional repertoire, and is so, how?,\n",
      "8,423,1,Carly I really appreciated your comments regarding rewards and computer time, it's something I struggle with a lot and still don't really know how to react.  I actually saw that a little bit in my first practicum, and it was NOT explained to the rest of the class; that being said, in a grade 8 context, everybody was pretty clear that the individuals in question had some behavioural issues.  In fact, I think I struggled more with it than the students - in some ways it seemed to be rewarding them for simply refraining from behaving like jerks, and that should be a baseline.  I think part of it was my own lack of understanding of just what kind of behavioural issues these kids actually had, which was exposed a little bit later.  But that doesn't answer the question - how do you accomodate certain behavioural difficulties without \"outing\"?  To which I really have no good answer.\n",
      "  However, for the various learning styles/needs/disabilities, I keep coming back to the phrase \"but that's just good teaching!\"  Why do we have even have time limits for any students - ie, what are we actually gaining from that, is it truly a better test (assessment) of their capacity?  Why do we print things small?  Why don't we use more graphic organizers?  I'm doing ESL primary support with my practicum teacher, and he keeps saying \"we'll try not to take them out of kindergarten and gr.1 - right now, they're in the perfect (scaffolded) learning environment with most of the supports that they need.\"  Why is that true in a k-1, but not in a 2-12?  What changes could we be making to our overall pedagogy and assesment methods which would support all students and make a lot of the \"changes\" for specific students uncessary because they're already in place? I know that would never account for all support, but I get this niggling feeling that it would deal with a lot of it.,\n",
      "8,426,1,  Carly-I was disappointed to hear of some of the experiences that you have had in the classroom. Luckily, I have been in classrooms where students have been very accepting and encouraging of accommodations for their peers. (E.g. computers for students who struggled with writing.) However, you raise an interesting point, the accommodations that I have seen have all been cognitive learning tools, not accommodations for behavior needs etc.\n",
      "  I would hope most students would be understanding of accommodations for learning, and if they aren't, perhaps the emphasis should be on community. Behavior needs may be much more complicated than learning needs (e.g. have trouble seeing a black board-you get a print copy. vrs. have trouble being around others ... ? )\n",

      "8,432,1,  There are two main points that each of you have talked about that I think are really important... the notion of fairness and how we address this within our classrooms, as well as touching upon Emilie's point of how do we support the students who may have undergone many things by 9am.\n",
      "  The idea of students being understanding and/or accepting of accommodations within the classroom, I think, brings us to the point of awareness.  As we have spoken about many times before, how a teacher approaches making students aware, and how they set up their classrooms as a safe space will definitely play a vital role in the students perspectives of accommodations for learning.  We need to create this environment right from the get-go.  A valid point that was brought up by Ed in a discussion we had earlier is the idea of being honest.  If we as teachers can be honest with our students about how we see our class and how we need to work as a community, a cohesive 'team,' then wont students be able to connect with us and feel as though they are a part of this community, no matter the accommodations neccessary. (I hope this makes sense)\n",
      "  To address the point of being equitable within the classroom, I believe is a challenging one, but so very neccessary.  How can we ensure that each and every individual student is being treated 'fairly' and provided an equal opportunity to partake in the community of the classroom, just as every other student in the class?  This part Emilie has definitely touched upon in terms of referring to what we have talked about time and again, the notion of making our teaching culturally relevant.  It would be ignorant to ignore the huge diversity of the students within our classroom.  In making our lessons and classroom environment culturally relevant we are taking one more step closer to allowing these students to have a sense of equity and belonging wtihin the classroom.  And still there is so much more that we can do.\n",
      "  The one thing that resonated with me the most after Monday's class is understanding that a lot can absolutely happen for a child before 9am.  We need to be conscious of this fact and make it known that we as teachers know it can be hard to delve right into school work first thing in the morning.  I believe we have discussed this in class before, but by simply saying goodmorning and welcoming the students into the room can set the tone for the day.  Another possible option could be to simply chat about something of interest to your class, or simply allowing your students to chat amongst themselves for a few moments to ease into the day.  I definitely do not have an absolute answer for this but am 100% behind you Emilie in wanting to learn more on how we can 'bring them into the present,' each and everyday.\n",
      "  If we as educators want to help students understand that we are aware of the fact that they live lives outside the classroom and that some of those situations can enter the classroom with them each morning, how can we go about making our students know that we are there to help them in any way we can, (without making them feel singled out or that their private lives are being intruded upon)?

      "Can I suggest that we should help students help themselves? While being 'fair' perhaps means doing some extra work for students (various accommodations of sorts), we won't be around their whole lives to help them out. So should we invest that time to teach them extra coping strategies or help them improve in their areas of weakness (so that they don't 'need' so much)? Are these issues better dealt with by Resource Teachers or EAs? Should we expect results, and thus gradually release responsibility, though never fully, from us to them, if we do teach to these things? ,\n",

      "  She walked up to one of the participants in our workshop and said \"before we go on break I just have a question, what size shoes do you wear?\"  The guy replied, \"11\" and she continued, \"Ok, so what is your favouirte type of running shoe? The best you've found?\"  He replied, \"I like Nike.\"  She then went on to say to everyone in the workshop, \"oK, so next week I thought we should get a bit more active and do some activities outside during our workshop. I just wanted to check and see what size and type of shoes we all need because I want to make sure we are prepared. I can go get them this weekend.\"  Immediately, a petite lady laughed and said, \"there's no way size 11 mens would fit me.\"  The presenter continued, \"Oh well I thought I'd be fair and just get everyone the same.\" The woman then said \"That's not fair, though!\"   And so on and so on... you see where I'm going.  She essentially proved that accomodations are fair in the most organic way and then left us to mull over that for our own break. I thought it was brilliant and I've used it in a lot of settings with students since.  I can think of a bunch of examples you can use in your class to encourage the same dialogue with your students in different settings - maybe you guys have other ideas too?\n",

      "8,438,1,Hi All,\n",
      "  Great discussion thread! Like Michelle, I am very interested in how we actually create equitable classrooms that advantage all. In reading all your posts I kept coming back to empathy. Maybe I'm very idealistic, but I believe that if empathy is something instilled in students from the get go, maybe less of the \"not fair\" comments will pop up in class. Coming from an experiential learning background, I've always been a fan of doing team builders or experiential activities where students have to experience things from another students shoes and have found that long after those activities students still remember tid bits of what it feels like for their peers...long after any \"talk\" I gave about empathy. For example, I used to work at Frank Oke, a high school for students with special needs in Toronto, and in one of my workshops I had a student who was blind (and had an EA). One day the student, call him H, got really frustrated during a game because students kept getting him out the quickest. After the workshop I talked ot him about it and he said \"nobody get's it and it would be easier if they just did.\" We talked for awhile about how we could help his peers understand the struggles he deals with and he came up with something similar to a trust walk that he could lead them all in. Now I have to say, he was one courageous kid and I don't know if all kids would take this on themselves (a teacher might have to initiate the activities), but the next workshop he led them in a blind-folded trust walk around the school and it was phenomenal. Powerful even. We debriefed the experience a bit afterwards and H told his classmates that he didn't want them to avoid getting him out, but more just be aware of what he can or can't do and maybe play some games that he wants to play or can play more easily every once in awhile. I admit, I likely probably hadn't done a good enough job facilitating that from the get go, but we live and learn right?    Anyway, I feel like I'm story telling a lot this morning... more just want to say that I believe students will get the reason behind our choices if they can feel for one another and really step in their shoes, not necessarily just because we say so.     These brilliant opportunities don't always pop up and like Nikki, I wonder about \"outing\" students, but I guess at the end of the day I'm learning more towards openly discussing everyone's accomodations no matter what they are than protecting or keeping an accomodation on the DL.\n",

      "This article challenges both the notion that race is a biologically or otherwise a deterministic concept and the notion that race is an illusion - an ideological construct and a false consciousness.\n",
      "  The authors propose an alternative conception of race, called \"racial formation\". It proposes race a fluid concept. Both individual racial identities and collective group identities are a process that both shaps and is shaped by political, economic, and social forces. This definition attempts to acknowledge that despite the lack of intrinsic scientific (biological) merit to the concept, 500 years of social enforcement have arranged social structures and identity formations in a way that makes race a social reality.\n",
      "  Repsonse:\n",
      "While I can see the merit of the racial formation theory I have little personal experience with the concept of racial identity. Personally, I have never considered my race as a major part of my identity and do not identify with the authors claim that being without a racial identity is \"akin to being genderless\" and \"to be in danger of having no identity\".\n",
      "  On the other hand, I can relate it to my personal experience of ethnic/national/religious identity, which I also feel is a very fluid concept. I often feel uncomfortable when people ask me \"Are you Jewish?\". I feel like I cannot simply answer yes or no. I grew up in Israel in a secular family. We considered our culture as Israeli rather than Jewish. I chose Canada as my home. I do not practice any religion and do not feel part of Jewish culture. On the other hand, I cannot completely deny my family history, background, and heritage.\n",
      "  If you asked my mother the same question, her answer would be more clear cut:\"It doesn't matter how I want to define myself - Hitler has already defined it for my grandfather. Therefore I am Jewish\".\n",

      "8,443,3,Your summary of the article is fantastic, Zack.\n",
      "  In response to your response, and also the article, I would like to respond by saying that  the fluidity of \"race\"is something that shapes my day-to-day life.\n",
      "  The idea of racial construction as an illusion that is ideological, but that also pervades our lives is very real to me. Somewhat ironically, I neither occupy the \"black\" box, nor the \"white\" box when I look at race. I'm other. Most people are other. I fit, but I don't fit. I'm part of a huge diaspora of Armenian people, but I neither fit in my \"community\" here in Canada (a place almost without its own racial identifier), nor do I fit with my original home country (my parents were born and raised in Turkey). But somehow, I always say, I'm Armenian, before I say I'm Canadian. I've always found that, at least racially, I've always felt displaced - and yet, I feel most myself in Canada. Identity, I feel, much like the authors and Zack, is fluid, because it changes on context and circumstance. In the same way, it is a way of helping others figure out who and what I am - in a sense, what they should do, categorically with me. People seem to need it more than I do, because I've grown to see myself as without. As I fill out \"white\" or \"middle-eastern\", in bubbles I consider, what will I be today? It matters so much more to the survey readers then to me.\n",
      "  Being a teacher, I think that's what I bring. Race is a way that society organizes our students, and sometimes, how our students organize themselves, but race is a construct, it need not oppress them or give them a feeling of being displaced, it is merely a ideological construct that they can transcend, if they choose to. I guess the question, then, is how?\n",

      "  I had a very similar questions when watching this video. As educators, we do our best to offer a variety of instructional practices and in so doing, we ensure  students get what they need to be successful. I value the video's perspective that equality means that all students get what they need rather then that all students get the same thing. I would openly discuss this with my students - such that they are aware that they will not get the same thing but they will get what they need to be successful. I will encourage open dialogue with my students such that they come to me when they need something or inform me of ways they believe they learn best.\n",
      "  As a response to your question, I would speak to the student and inform them that I am doing my best to assist them. If a student is not willing to comply, I would discuss strategies with the parent(s) to find out other ways to help the child. Lastly, I would ask the student to provide ways that he/she thinks is best to enhance their learning. In other words, I would come down to the student's level and hear their perspectives in the learning process. This will ensure that we minimize the barrier between student and teacher and further exemplify a classroom community where student and teacher are partners in the learning. ,\n",

The idea is not that the individual is disabled but rather that the environment around the individual is disabled.  I like the idea that in order to make things \"fair\" we need our environments to support individual needs. i.e by providing a computer to a student with autism who has difficulty communitcating otherwise we are providing a platform for this particular child to communicate just as well as other students can without computers.  To me, this is the definition of fairness, not everyone having the same thing (i.e. everyone getting a computer) - the same message as the shoes.\n",

      "  I just finished reading Poverty by Postal code.  2 of the reccomendations are as follows:\n",
      "  1) Make housing affordable throughout various neighbourhoods so that low income families do not gravitate to, and become concentrated in the least expensive areas of the city and 2) Provide livable incomes (increase minimum wage).\n",
      "  In response, I wanted to pose the following questions:\n",
      "  1) Is there a precedent in any other scenario other than housing where affordable is infused with exclusive? In other words, is there anyway to create a housing market that has low income and high-income housing beside one another? Can you think of any examples of this?\n",
      "  (* please forgive my choice of words i.e. exclusive, I cannot think of better term right now)\n",

      "  Empathy in general takes time to develop for students (as well as teachers), so younger students in particular may see accommodations as \"non-essential\" and just focus on their own lack of assistance as the root of unfairness. I think it's most effective to just give the \"assignment deadline extension\" analogy; there will be times when a student needs an extension for an assignment because of illness, may be absent for extracurriculars, etc. and it's something virtually all students can relate to or understand.\n",

      "8,450,1,Re: \"What about making things 'fair' for people of different socio-economic statuses? Backgrounds? Languages? etc.\"\n",
      "  As much as some of us may feel a moral imperative to do all we can to provide support for students who have more than enough on their plate from home (abusive parents, arduous commutes, etc.), some things are just out of bounds for teacher intervention/assistance for legal reasons or to prevent the \"incremental creeping\" of students asking for more and more help.\n",

      "8,451,1,Awesome, thanks! ,\n",
      "8,452,1,To me the concept of race is a convenient way to sort and describe people with marked vs. unmarked traits regardless of how they arise. The roots of these racial traits vary with the context, but as they persist over a wide population and over time, the mechanisms by which these traits arise seem to matter less than the sheer fact that many certain traits seem to \"correlate\" with each other. Differences are differences, and as long as the correlation is compelling enough, they're simply noted as racial characteristics.\n",
      "  I think it's important for teachers and students to discuss/revisit how the notion of race became so deeply embedded within the human psyche that we developed a collective blind spot in its usage. The idea (I emphasize idea) that African Americans and Jamaicans have a natural advantage when it comes to sprinting and that Kenyans (especially concentrated around the town of Eldoret) are naturally superior at distance running due to Darwinian selection/gene-muscle-fibre expression/mitochondrial DNA is as real and tangible as the idea that high altitude living, rituals of cattle raiding, circumcision, and certain marriage practices sculpted a Kenyan tribe over two thousand years to possess superior athletic stamina. As the article points out, obviously, there are traits that are consistent among a \"race\" and cannot be explained by biology, but race isn't nonexistent either in the sense that many of us (as individuals) have moments of identification with certain cultural groups.\n",
      "  As a teacher, I wonder how to acknowledge these traits and observed correlations (and possibly propose mechanisms for causation) in the classroom without inadvertently encouraging the idea that they strictly define us.\n",
      "  Jonathan Marks, an anthropologist at U North Carolina, once said\n",
      "  \"All human groups, however constituted, have particular medical risks. African Americans, Ashkenazi Jews, Afrikaners and Japanese, poor people, rich people, chimney sweeps, prostitutes, choreographers, and the Pima Indians all have their particular health risks. And race is not the cause of it; in fact, race will positively obscure it.\"\n",
      "  Given that this is true, it would be one way to suggest that race doesn't determine the traits we see, but the other way round; that traits (not just biological, but cultural too) partly determines our ideological construct of race. On the other hand, you wouldn't call blood type or proficiency in a certain subject area a racial category. How then, would you talk about race and all the real things in life that come with it? (How do I convince a traditional Asian student who is ashamed of not fitting his own stereotype when he performs poorly on a math test that race is just an overblown heuristic?)\n",

Even after watching it, the one important point that sticks with me is the definition of fairness which is defined differently than what some of us, including myself, probably thought. The idea that everyone should get what they need, rather than get the same as everyone else, is important for our classroom, especially when we are accomodating and modifying for those students who NEED the support.\n",
      "  The video also brings up an important point about parents and how many are playing the juggling/balancing act to support their children and providing different support to their children depending on their varying needs. As the video mentioned, it may not always seem \"fair\" but it is what is necessary.\n",
      "  Lorne, you bring up some really good questions that cannot be so clearly answered. In addition to your questions, I question to what extent should teachers be \"fair\" to those students who need support before extra assisstance be brought into the classroom for those students?

      "While an individual may choose not to consider race as a major part of their identity, it is nonetheless viewed and construed outside the self, by other individuals and society at large. One person may have the luxury of downplaying the role/power of their perceived race, while another may not.\n",
      "  The article seeks to counter claims of race's invisibility. When it describes conservatives who \"argue that race is an illusion\", I immediately thought of Stephen Colbert's onscreen persona, who continually claims he \"[doesn't] see race\"1, and asks interview subjects what race they are. He is satirizing a process that many enact every day: trying to pretend that race identity formation doesn't account for institutional privileges that certain populations hold.\n",
      "  These privileges are the result, not only of racial identity, but of ability, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, citizenship, and language. However, the article does not claim to investigate every single one of those, instead focusing on the vast topic of race.\n",

As a teacher it is important to teach our students life lessons (i.e. the meaning of true fairness). It is important to explain the concept of fairness at the beginning of the year to students, so that as situations arise they understand why some people are receiving extra support. Furthermore, if a classroom is built on values of a community, students will be open to helping their fellow peers.\n",

In their place are less healthy options (i.e. fast food). The reason for this is grocery stores are more likely to receive better business in affluent areas, so from a business perspective, why would they situate themselves in areas where people have less disposable income? People in these areas are also less likely to have access to a car, making it more difficult to access grocery stores.\n",

      "  Interesting read with theories that speak to this issue. For example, the theory, 'education for the other,' focusing on improving the experience for students who are othered, or some way oppressed. It talks about creating an harmful space.\n",
      "On one level, to the theorists, this means providing a separate space where students who face different forms of oppression can go for help, support, advocacy, resources and so forth.

      "  I agree that if students in the classroom aren't understanding of accommodations made for their peers, that the focus must be shifted on developing a safe community in the classroom.  As others have stated in their responses, I believe that it is important that there is an open dialogue in the classroom surrounding accommodations made and fair/equitable practices in the classroom, making sure that all students are getting what they need and are understanding and supportive of their classmates.  I agree that behaviour needs can be more difficult to address equitably and that there are many factors other than direct learning needs, that affect a students' experience and that must acknowledged (socio-economic status, lanugages, etc.).  I think you had raised a very important point here and it is something that we must all be aware of in the classroom.\n",
      "  Although the depth of these issues can not be stated simply, I do believe that developing a positive, inclusive, and safe community in the classroom allows for much more ease when addressing the issue of 'fairness'.  Creating a community environment in the classroom could also help reduce the gap that students may be feeling between their experiences in their daily lives, and those in the classroom.  With a solid foundation in the classroom, perhaps students will feel comfortable and supported by their peers (and teacher), and through a morning routine/activities, we can work to bridge the gap as students enter the classroom.  We as teachers must be aware that there is so much going on in our students' lives, even prior to their arrival at 9am.\n",

After having skimmed both readings, I am dying to ask: whose interests are REALLY being represented? It seems as though the goal of the Task Force is to have the neighbourhoods take charge of making change in their areas, with the assistance and guidance of the Task Force. However, there is very little representation of each neighbourhood within the Task Force.\n",
      "  For example, the \"Investment Board\" - which will help decide what projects get funding and which don't - is made up of government officials, school board representatives and United Way representative. Six community members are also a part of the board, but it seems that they are nominated by the other members of the board, not by the community.\n",

While gaining new insights into the Task Force and ways in which we can assist marginalized groups in Toronto, these readings allow me to consider the implications on the education system and our students as a whole. Sometimes teachers put pressure on students to complete their homework, assignments and study for upcoming tests. But what we fail to realize at times is that our diverse students have so many other pressures happening in their lives outside of school. Students living in poverty have other necessities to consider other then school-related tasks. Does school add to their pressures? How can we as educators alleviate their external pressures?\n",
      "  My mom has been an Educational Assistant in a low socio-economic neighbourhood in Toronto. It was not uncommon for her to see students come to school without lunch or discussing their family troubles. These students tend to be the ones whom were demoralized in school and unmotivated to achieve. Can you really blame them? As teachers, should we focus on getting students to \"achieve the grade\" or perhaps acknowledge that our students have too much to deal with? How active of a role should we play in a student's life outside of school? I believe it is important to learn about our students' lives outside of school to fully understand how we can best assist them in their current state of living. ,\n",

      "8,486,2,  After reading the report on “Strong Neighborhoods”, a question comes to mind, well many actually: if our population is constantly increasing within our city, mainly due to immigration, as stated in the report, then wouldn’t there be more of a need for public services?  Whether or not the organization and implementation of these services is lagging behind the need or not, due to funding, government knowledge of the need itself, etc, why have we been hearing about schools closing down within the city recently due to low student enrollment?  Wouldn’t school enrollment be increasing because of population growth?\n",
      "  I can understand why the government would be closing down schools to save money on operating costs etc., but is this a step in the wrong direction, or is the money saved by shutting down schools in one neighborhood being used to invest into the “at risk” neighborhoods, and public services there?  More questions than answers, and even more keep coming up as I think about the topic…,\n",

      "  United Way. (2005). Strong neighbourhoods: A call to action. GTA 13 Priority Communities.\n",
      "  Poverty by Postal Code paints an alarming picture of Toronto as a city where the disparity between rich and poor is out of scale with the rest of the country: a city where at-risk neighbourhoods plunge even further into poverty, and job growth slows to a crawl. Social assistance rates have flatlined and benefits have actually been reduced. Thirteen priority neighbourhoods, many located in Toronto's inner suburbs, show the effects of being ignored by policy makers. Their residents face serious barriers to employment and housing, and the number of high poverty pockets is increasing.\n",
      "  United Way's 2005 call to action delineates the aims of three bodies1 dedicated to improving outcomes in these high-poverty neighbourhoods. Funding will come from all three levels of government, and initiatives will proceed in partnership and consultation with local communities, combating the negative effects of gentrification and empowering diverse populations to build strong, healthy, appealing neighbourhoods.\n",
      "  Discussion Questions:\n",
      "  1. [How] can we address poverty, and the growing disparity between the rich and poor, in our classrooms? How best to discuss it in an equitable manner which doesn't cause more harm than good? Can it be incorporated into the curriculum, and if so, how?\n",
      "  2. The United Way report compiled data from the long-form Statistics Canada census. Now that the long-form census has been eliminated, how can we accurately gauge the situation in our schools' neighbourhoods? What resources are available to teachers seeking to inform themselves of the sociological terrain? What is your reaction to the elimination of the long-form census?\n",
      "  3. How can you best advocate for students in these high-poverty neighbourhoods? What does that look like, and how comfortable are you with being an advocate? To what extent do you plan to liaise with parents/family/guardians/community members?\n",
      "  4. When teaching students in affluent neighbourhoods, how can we equitably discuss Toronto's poverty, without creating an us-and-them atmosphere? How can we remain mindful that even in the most affluent neighbourhoods, there is poverty and inequity?\n",
      "  5. What is the balance between intervention and curricular objectives? How much time are you willing to spend to create a safe space for students living in poverty, and are you prepared to justify your actions to school administrative bodies if they object?\n",

That could cost him his international mobility?

On the first day one girl immediately shut off, insisting that her younger brother would do so much better even before she even got a chance to run her first program. At the end of the unit though, it was clear that all the girls developed the confidence to get past the stereotype and even become proficient in basic programming skill and the thought-processes involved.

Basically last year, a member of OSSTF (not a spokesperson re this particular matter) told last year's IS grads that they would enter in at A3. Dick and Jim are trying to get in touch with OSSTF to have this confirmed/denied, but are having issues reaching them. However they have been in touch with past MT grads in IS who are currently working (the few who got jobs) and they all entered in at A4, so their point was until we hear of an MT grad entering in at A3, it is safe to assume we all enter in at A4.\n",

It ranks up there in its \"standardness\" level along with the likes of MS Word, Prezi, and SMARTboard, and it's quite powerful for freeware. Three out of four schools I've visited last year have Audacity on all their computers, but only at one of them have I met a teacher who knew how to use its features thoroughly.\n",

However, it goes a long way as a valuable skill that students can use to enhance any multimedia project throughout their years at school. It may even give some students an appreciation for the kind of studio work involved in music editing as they think about their favourite songs that more often than not use audio engineering or special effects.\n",

      "  Despite the fact that the heart attack reference was a bit extreme, I think there is a valid reason he used it. You may not immediately kill a student, but slowly, the inequities in classrooms add up, leaving many kids depressed or anti-learning. This may not kill them, but it will make their learning differences turn into handicaps and limit their futures. As teachers, it's really important to us to show students that their limits can, with appropriate knowledge, tools, coping mechanisms or oppourtunities, be overcome. If children don't believe that, we effectively kill their spirit of hope and optimism. As such, it is a kind of death.\n",

On the first day one girl immediately shut off, insisting that her younger brother would do so much better even before she even got a chance to run her first program. At the end of the unit though, it was clear that all the girls developed the confidence to get past the stereotype and even become proficient in basic programming skill and the thought-processes involved.

Three out of four schools I've visited last year have Audacity on all their computers, but only at one of them have I met a teacher who knew how to use its features thoroughly.\n",

However, it goes a long way as a valuable skill that students can use to enhance any multimedia project throughout their years at school. It may even give some students an appreciation for the kind of studio work involved in music editing as they think about their favourite songs that more often than not use audio engineering or special effects.\n",

      "  Last year, in the midst of all the Regent Park redevelopments, I realized that the first grocery store in Regent Park had just opened, quite literally down the street from my house.  While I had spent years living beside Regent, I was so oblivious to the fact that the neighbourhood actually didn't have a great deal of resources within it, like grocery stores, that could drastically improve the quality of life for residents. While there were grocery stores relatively close, I realized when the new store opened that residents were likely challenged by the lack of resources close by.  Within weeks of the store opening it was interesting to see families flocking to the store on Sundays, or parents who were shift workers buying their groceries at all hours of the night.  I admit, I had totally taken this basic access to food completely for granted because I was able to pick up groceries on the way home from school at Ryerson, or hop on the TTC to make my trek home with bags that much easier.   I appreciated reading Poverty by Postal Code and other reports that come from a similar vein, because I gained a lot more perspective on the lived experiences in the neighbourhoods where I used to live or live close by to.  I don't want to be too idealistic about the Regent Park redevelopments because I do have concerns about things I have seen or heard, but I do think that access is a step in the right direction.   For example, right beside the grocery store is now a 24 hour Tim Hortons. It is packed! Though it may seem small, having a 24 hour coffee shop has really made that one corner a social spot for older individuals in the community, families and teenagers. And, from what I've seen from studying in there or grabbing coffees with my friends, it is a really positive space!\n",

The fact that the reputation of certain areas, in this case Jane and Finch, are perpetuated by their negative representation in the media, and are in fact not truly representative of the population living in those areas.  For example, the two community members in this video mentioned that they were shocked that there was a shooting at C.W. Jeffries, a really good school, whereas the media simply wrote it off as being linked to the area in which the school is located.\n",

      "  It is evident that communities play a critical role in the lives of our students. Social class, background, ethnicity, culture - all of these aspects of our students' lives are embedded in the community they live and ultimately have an effect on their school life. Systemically, low socio-economic schools are marginalized, underfunded, and unsupported in a school system that is dominated by a \"middle-class Eurocentric ethos of society.\"\n",

      "  -Cak,\n",
      "8,581,1,It is great that we are seeing people come out to speak about these issues: in the book we read for class \"life at the intersection\", and most importantly to the media, which is the perpetuator of such negative stereotypes.  It really shines a light on the media itself as a propoganda machine, even here in home Canada.  Most people will listen to the news and take everything as unaltered fact, unbiased, and objective, which it is for the most part, as far as I know, or maybe im just one of those people :P.  The only thing is that they may choose to overgeneralize or overemphasize certain points, and leave some out for \"the good of the citizens\".  Jane-Finch is a scapegoat, I have come to realize, in the truest sense.  It seems like it is there to put clearly defined boarders around violence within our city, even though violence is taking place everywhere.  It is there to make people who do not live there feel safe in their own neighbourhoods, at the cost of the people whom the media are \"black listing\" by association to their geographical location.\n",
      "  There must be at least some truth in stereotypes, why else would they exist if it was not so?  However, the problem is when these ideas get generalized and overextended by the power of the masses.  This is what has happened to the Jane-Finch neighbourhood.  By people speaking out and having their voices heard, it is the only way for this stereotype, which has been prolonged by many years of stoking, to be exposed for what it really is.  The question is whether or not \"the man\" will allow this to happen.,\n",
      "8,582,1,I too would like to thank you for that video Alex!\n",
      "  And in response to Andrea, I think the topic of how the media portrays certain communities, such as the Jane and Finch area, can be extremely negative and have a huge impact on these communities.  Growing up I went to high school with many students who lived at or near Jane and Finch and their personal opinions of their neighbourhood were always very different from what it was we were reading about and being \"told\" essentially.  I think that because we see only the surface of the community, and tend to jump to conclusions based on what I would call a biased interpretation in some cases, we can 'accidentally' become ignorant and unaware.  Just like it discusses in this weeks readings, \"Life at the Intersection\" many of the residence at Jane and Finch find their surroundings comfortable, safe, have a sense of community, and enjoy living there.  I am very much looking forward to this weeks class discussions so that we can further unpack this book as well as the stereotypes that exist.\n",
      "  As well, in response to Lucas I think that it is so important for us to realize that there is indeed violence everywhere.  It is all a matter of what becomes the top media story, and how it is portrayed.  I am again, very much looking forward to discussing all of these topics in class.\n",
      "  Here is my final thought, I am sure we are all interested in helping to speak out and have our voices heard, as Lucas has mentioned, and besides bypassing, for lack of a better word, the pressure of the \"man\" how could we as a community go about discussing such issues on a level that will create a positive impact?  Is this at all possible?,\n",
      "8,583,1,I just wanted to say thank you again to those who told their stories last class.  I have been thinking about them all week and have really been reevaluating who I see myself as.  The impact of story telling is quite remarkable and has proven, in past experiences, that it is a fantastic way to connect with one another, build a community, and evoke questions in ourselves.\n",
      "  Before last weeks class, I think I would have shared a very different story than I will when the time comes for me to share.\n",

If you have suggestions on how best we could make our cohort a safe, inclusive space, post them here! And then hopefully we can sort out the timing in an expedient, but not rushed, manner. - Laura\n",
      "  I would suggest that we start planning it now so we can hopefully do something before practicum. Do we need an external facilitator, and if so, do we have suggestions?\n",
      "  If we are going to do something like this we should probably agree on ground rules. The following are only a suggestion, feel free to modify, add, or delete as you see fit (-Zack):\n",
      "1) Participation is voluntary: we encourage everyone in the class to participate and acknowledge that each one of us contributes to a caring community. That being said, decision to participate is personal and no one should feel coerced to participate.\n",
      "2) We acknowledge that our classroom environment is currently not safe for everyone and want to take concrete steps to remedy the situation.\n",
      "3) We agree to speak honestly and respectfully, and acknowledge that others' personal experience/perspective may be different from our own.\n",
      "4) We agree to listen attentively and without judgement as others are sharing their perspectives. We agree to only talk during our turn.\n",
      "  Hi all!  It's Heather... Just wanted to follow up because last I checked this was still a go. Laura, thanks for starting this thread. Zack, thanks for contributing.\n",
      "  I agree that whatever we do has to be facilitated with a purpose and with ground rules, boundaries...whatever you want to call it. I think it is important that everyone is heard, but everyone also knows what our goal is in the end so that we can all keep it in mind while we share and discuss. I can only speak for myself and for me it comes down to what I've said through SALT before... I'd love to see us create a caring, connected and empowered community in our class.\n",
      "  I agree that people should not be peer pressured to do anything, including be in attendance, but I have to say that I don't think the process will work and any real progress will be made on a collective front if people are missing. Everyone is important to our community.\n",
      "I disagree regarding the suggestion that not everyone has to participate, but maybe that is because I see participation in much the same way as Wesley. Participation can simply be listening and being a positive presence in the room or exercising your right to pass after hearing others out.  I think it is essential that everyone in our class is present for the discussions because we do spend a large period of time together and in many senses we operate as a cohort. If people are not present and someone wishes to speak to them or share an idea with them I believe our peace building session may be stalled.\n",
      "[Zack] I moderated the phrasing to reflect your input.\n",
      "  I get that last minute issues and emergencies come up of course and that this exercise would ask us all to carve out a few more hours of our busy schedules, but I would like to suggest that we all try to be present, if not to share our thoughts, but to listen to that of others. Also, participating in a peace building activity could be one of the greatest lessons we learn while at OISE.\n",
      "  Anyway, when would people be interested in doing it? Next Thursday morning? The following Thursday morning? Following Laura's thoughts, I think we should consider doing this before practicum.\n",
      "[Zack] Thursday mornings would not work for me and probably for several others. I suggest an afternoon. Also, Judy is teaching a class on Thursday morning if we choose to ask her to facilitate.\n",

      "Yes? No?  (How do I ask these questions without us going around in circles, haha?)\n",
      "  [Zack] I doubt that they will agree to do it for free. We are talking about a significant time commitment. That being said, if we split the cost, it should not be more than a few dollars per person.\n",

For some of us she's almost become a motherly figure and I would really enjoy having her with us.

      "It's been a year of damage, of talking, of ignoring and perpetuating the idea that we were 'fine'.  I do believe it needs to be talked about, and I would much prefer someone who knows us already, to save time (preferably Judy.), I might also be cynical in that this could be an incredibly long process (multiple sessions) and that some of us may not be wanting/willing/committed to put in this time and effort for what amounts to 6 more months of possibly being together.  Yes, arguably the process of conflict resolution and community re-building would be beneficial, but from a logisitics stand, putting 28 people through group-therapy (which is essentially what we're doing) is, from my own profesisonal background, a giant task, especially when many of us may not have done such processes, or are aware of the processes that go on in group faciliation/planning.  It might be too large of a task too late, of which more damage may come from forcing it. (-Tori, if you're interested in what 'group processes' mean from a counselling lens, poke me :) )\n",

I did not follow the event closely in the news, but my general perception had been that the shooting was gang related and that jordan was mistakenly identified as someone else by gang members. Now when I reread in more details about the story I realise that we might never know the real reason for the murder. The accused boys, who  pleaded not guilty, have been acquited since. I wonder how much of the general media coverage of Jane and Finch as a gang-infested neigbourhood had contributed to this false perception I had had.\n",

I think a big-brother type of mentor, who is closer to the students' age and does not need to grade the students at the end of the term can be more effective.\n",
      "  3. First, I think we need to see the student as an individual and not as \"Jane and Finch\" student. I liked what Jean said - as much as possible, try to create a mental clean slate in your mind. Second, we need to treat students with respect, even if at first we might not feel respected by them. Respecting students is more than just being polite to them - it includes respecting them as a learner. If our lesson plans do not enable the students to access the curriculum, students feel disrespected.

      "8,616,1,Hi Jim, here are my Introduction and Literacy Review attached....I was wondering if you could read it over and make some suggestions.  I also have the beginnings of my Methodology in this doc.\n",
      "  Thanks,\n",
      "8,617,3,It is comforting to know that some individuals like Marc Prensky recognize the cultural disconnect between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants at a level of specificity beyond the almost amorphous imperative, “In the 21st Century, we have to integrate technology in a way that is meaningful and relevant to students!” Too often have I watched professional development sessions or heard teacher candidates advocate admirable goals like digital citizenry or technological literacy but neglect to describe what such objectives look and feel like. No one even mentions how we get there. “I think we as teachers need to ensure that we don’t use technology purely for the sake of using technology” is now common parlance. It’s about time we dug deeper and figured out what that actually means.\n",
      "  I appreciate Prensky’s diverse anecdotes of Digital Immigrant “accents” (my personal favourite is illustrated by the following xkcd comic). They are subtle reminders that in addition to overarching ideologies, the “little things in life” matter too. Even in 2001 when this paper was written, he already seems to have a clear idea of just what is lacking in the overlap between TK, PK and CK of the TPACK framework that professors Koehler & Mishra published five years later. Unfortunately, with all his pointing out what Digital Immigrants are doing wrong, Prensky isn’t as diligent in proposing a concrete plan to fix it. A particularly critical reader may even be insulted by his concluding remark, “if Digital Immigrant educators really want to reach Digital Natives—i.e. all their students—they will have to change” and almost condescending Nike reference, “Just do it!”\n",
      "    As long as there are professionals who are well-versed in the nuances and functions—the “little things that matter”—of various technologies, there is little reason why they cannot facilitate professional development among colleagues in the same way it has long taken place in other pedagogical areas. Educational libraries are chock-full of resources or literature providing lists of step-by-step teaching strategies for classrooms of different sizes and for specific scenarios, with detailed rationales for those strategies. Such resources describe their merits, disadvantages, and alternative measures, and often minimize reference to underlying theoretical framework. In the technological world, the equivalent would be a video game walkthrough. Yet it is a wonder that no reliable “walkthrough” has emerged among the education community. And it is a wonder that despite Prensky taking the time to highlight all the inadequacies of the stereotypical Digital Immigrant capped with his “Just do it” manifesto, a gaping hole still stands between current widespread demand for classroom technology, and currently existing archives of ready-to-download SMART Board templates. That hole is a void of overwhelming helplessness where educators don’t know what they don’t know, and only the likes of Prensky can facilitate the first step of revealing that to them.\n",
      "  In other words, Digital Immigrants need to be shown the way across that hole (though not necessarily led by the hand). For me, that means taking a bottom-up approach and literally teaching what our tools are capable of doing before we pretend to know how they fit in an educational context. While technology pervasiveness has been approaching monumental proportions since the 1990s, we need to bear in mind that bare bones technology is not at all intuitive. Try explaining to a Digital Immigrant the difference between embedding a .wmv[1] into a PowerPoint document and embedding a YouTube video into an html document, as was recently asked of me, and it will become clear that the seemingly “little things” (like incompatible multimedia file formats) can insidiously derail an entire lesson and forever discourage future attempts to use digital media. Only when we all have some common ground in basic technological function (just as one should expect any capable math teacher to know basic arithmetic) can one be ready to discuss fruitfully about what sets outstanding hardware and software apart from the duds. â–\n",
      "\n",
      "[1] Without installing third-party codecs, the .wmv video format is only playable on proprietary software developed by Microsoft. While a teacher education program is probably not the place to address such technicality, it is worth mentioning an incident at one of my practicum blocks whereby a teacher allegedly gave up showing YouTube videos altogether “because” the school’s computers didn’t support the video her son extracted for her from a DVD at home. It is also worth mentioning that it didn’t matter to the teacher that YouTube had absolutely nothing to do with her son’s extraction in the first place!\n",

      "8,621,1,   Reading Prensky’s article begs the question: Just who ARE these supposed digital natives? Written in the USA in 2001, referring to students in k-onwards, it is predicated on a number of assumptions: Access to television, video games, and the internet.  What of those who have limited access due to family choices, or raised outside of the US (or Canada) in less privileged environments?  While Prensky was clearly frustrated by teachers who completely and unilaterally rejected use of any technology, which likely came from a place of experience and frustration, his underlying suggestion that places individuals into camps irrespective of their socio-economic status, place of birth, and access to resources warrants major scrutiny.  The loaded terminology of ‘immigrant’ and ‘native’ implies a differential that catches a number of nuances not sufficiently explored in this article.\n",
      "   I expect there are as few Canadians who could claim truly ‘native’ status in the realm of the digital as in the realm of the political.  Likewise, whether that heritage truly equips you to explore your birthright is as equally problematic.  Even for “immigrants” we recognize all of the variables predicated on socio-economic class.  The question for me is “just what are those variables for the ‘digital’ realm”?  Similarly, are there are downfalls to being born into this area?  Despite Presnky’s definition which places me at the edge of the supposed “native” generation, my students have had a completely different experience of technology.  While I do not see a fundamental divide in how we interact with the use of technology for specific end goals, the difference is less in our ability to leverage technology productively, and more in the presence of absence of a lens which also assesses technology as a possible hindrance which deserves to be put aside in search of increased concentration or appropriate human interaction.  Is that a skill which needs nurturing?\n",
      "My perception is coloured by many exchanges over the years with my “digital immigrant” former roommate and his wife, a professor and a law librarian respectively, who constantly share their frustration with a generation they consider digital “natives” and yet are completely unaware of how even to leverage the full power available in a Google search, corroborated by own experiences in a grade 4 and 8 classroom.  As native, you don’t always know what you don’t know.\n",
      "   The question of “flow” must also be posed.  Was Monkey Wrench engaging because it was a “game,” or because the medium allowed it to differentiate itself to meet the zone of proximal development?  Is it truly the medium of instruction, or an intermediary quality which one medium tends to be better equipped to access than another? There is also the question of human to human interaction, as opposed to human to machine or human to human mediated by machine which was not explored and which makes me profoundly uneasy to completely eliminate in the name of “catering” to natives’ learning styles.\n",
      "   My background in ergonomics also raises strong concerns regarding the unmitigated enthusiasm for long term, regular technology use.  Finally, we are all “digital” natives, equipped with amazing dexterity to alter the world to our needs and liking.  Even scissor use is a valid outcome of kindergarten, acknowledging that some potentials of our bodies are realized more fully by some than others, and most of it has to do with actually exposure and practice, which in turn an educational system and teacher can potentially help to increase.  That holds as true in the realm of digital data as in true “digital” manipulation.  My concern of placing individuals in some arbitrary camp is that it fails to consider and support the multitude of factors which could lead to true mastery, or to consider the negative consequences to technology use which need to be counteracted. I intend to explore a variety of tools in my classrooms, where “tools” are those objects capable of increasing learning.  However, that has been an active process requiring active investment in learning technologies which had no inherent interest to me, and constantly researching and experimenting with tools during my personal time.  It is not a simple process and it is an unending one.  Prensky’s “Just Do It!” is scathing rather than supportive and fails to acknowledge the time and energy drain which keeping abreast of changing tools can require.  A methodology for addressing that issue from a systems perspective rather than as an individual imperative would have been more appropriate and likely more fruitful.,\n",

      "8,625,2,  When I was young, my face was always in front of a screen. I was either watching TV, playing videogames, or chatting with my friends online. Digital technology has always been a big part of my life. I had a strong affinity to it. In fact, within a year of my family getting our first computer, I had my own website up and running. The following year, the website served as an online portfolio for all my art work, including pieces I had produced in Adobe Photoshop. By the time I was in Grade 10, I knew html and practiced coding web pages from scratch using Microsoft Frontpage. I even memorized some of my favourite colour codes for html! To me, it is obvious that my understanding of digital technology is very different from that of older generations. I recognized this dichotomy back in high school when I was teaching my art/media literacy teacher how to use various Adobe software (Illustrator and Photoshop) as she tried to incorporate them into her program.\n",
      "  Reading through the Prensky article made me think about whether or not I am a Digital Native. I believe I am a Digital Native, but not because of my skill with a few software programs. Being a digital native does not require one to be particularly proficient with digital technology. I am much more comfortable with computers and smart phones than many middle school students whom I taught in previous placements, but that does not make them any less a digital native than I am. Being a digital native is all about a different kind of thinking. Digital natives thinking one way while digital immigrants think another. A digital immigrant’s accent can be seen despite their level of proficiency with a given technology. For example, one of my ATs was very good with using her Smartboard. She knew all the tools and features in SMART Notebook, but did not ever go past using it as an overpriced power point display, or a nifty white board. When I used the smartboard to teach my lessons, she commented that she never thought to use it in the ways that I did. She even asked to keep my Notebook files for later uses. So being a digital native is not about what you do, but how you think. Moreover, while digital immigrants like my AT can learn new strategies, techniques and tools that will work for her students, a digital native will be able to create them and really cater them to the needs of their students.\n",
      "  As a teacher who is a digital native, I am able to think like my students and understand what will work and what won’t. Including digital technology in my programs will be a natural and logical by-product of my ideas and thought processes. For example, Prensky talks about how to use calculators and computers to teach the multiplication table. I can’t imagine teaching it without using digital technology. Sitting down and memorizing the multiplication table goes against my way of thinking and thus my instinctive approach to how I would teach it. Rote memorization does not have immediate gratification or frequent rewards, unless it’s put into some kind of memory game. Such a game could incorporate a point system and achievements to be unlocked as the player progresses. This might not be the best idea, but it is the first thing that came to mind when I thought of how to teach the multiplication table. A quick search in the Apple App Store reveals many games (Time Tables Warp, Time Table Lite, Times Tables, and many more) designed to help students learn multiplication tables in just the way I described. In the end, my hope is not to be able to include digital technology into my program, because I know that will happen, but to design curricula in a way that not only engages my students, but also motivates them to succeed.\n",
      "     ,\n",
      "8,626,2,              When I first started reading Marc Prensky’s article, “Digital Native, Digital Immigrants,” my first response was to identify myself as a digital native. My family got our first computer when I was in grade three, and shortly after that I began using the Internet. From that point on, the Internet was always my primary source for finding information. It is now my primary source for mostly everything that I do. I don’t buy CDs; I download music. I don’t develop film; I upload photos from my phone. Not only do I receive things instantly, but I am accustomed to instantly sharing what I am doing with family an friends on social network sites. At first thought, I identified myself as a digital native.\n",
      "            As I continued to read the Prensky article, I began to identify hints of a “digital immigrant” accent within myself. This accent, however, is not as thick as my parents’ accent. I don’t read manuals before I attempt to use a program, and I am constantly trying to help my mother understand that computer programs will teach themselves. There are times, however, when I realize that I am more of a digital immigrant than my brother or other young people. For example, my first thought when Blockbuster closed down was “How will I ever rent movies again?” and I was surprised when people told me that they had been downloading movies for years. I was also frustrated when I learned in my publishing class that Indigo was converting the majority of its store to gift product, because books were going to be downloaded. For a true digital native, this probably wouldn’t be such terrible news. For the children of today, who are already reading books on ipads, it won’t matter at all.\n",
      "            When I have a classroom, I feel that I will be able to teach digital natives. I have been surrounded by technology and I have used technology enough so that I am not afraid of it, which is an issue that can occur with many digital immigrants. I know that technology is changing and evolving, and as I see it evolve faster and faster throughout the years I can understand and accept the fact that it is a way of life that must be adopted into the classroom. I am excited to incorporate it into all areas of my teaching.\n",
      "            As somebody who “Googles” every question that pops into her head at any given time, I can understand that students are able to receive any information that they want faster than we can explain it to them. It is not our job as teachers to pass on facts to our student. This may change the pedagogy of some teachers who have been teaching for a long time. Since student can already find information, I will probably spend more time teaching students how to critically evaluate and analyze the information that they receive. I will also teach them to look at a variety of sources to find their information, rather than just the textbooks, and I will use technology to help them discover concepts through inquiry.\n",
      "            For now, I think that my experience with technology will allow me to teach digital natives in ways that suit them. As technology changes and evolves, however, I am afraid that I will become further behind and eventually the students will catch up and possibly surpass my knowledge of technology. Some of them already have.\n",
      "            My goal for myself as a teacher is to stay current with technology and also with teaching pedagogy. In a few years, many of the things that I am doing with technology in my classroom will be irrelevant or boring. I want to keep up with the changing times so that my teaching practices and use of technology is relevant for all of the students in my classroom – even the ones many years from now. ,\n",

      "\n",
      "The Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) is an arm’s-length Crown agency. Its mandate includes the following objectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "To evaluate the quality and effectiveness of elementary and secondary school education, as well as the public accountability of boards.\n",
      "To develop and administer the marking of tests for this purpose. To develop systems for evaluation.\n",
      "To report on the above to the public and the minister and make recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To research and collect information on assessing academic achievement\n",
      "The EQAO tests include:\n",
      "mathematics, reading, and writing assessment at grade 3 and 6.\n",
      "mathematics assessment at grade 9. Unlike other EQAO tests, teachers may use the results of this test toward a final course grade. EQAO research suggests that students tend to take the test more seriously when they know it affects their course grade.\n",
      "literacy assessment at grade 10 (OSSLT). This is a mandatory requirement for high school graduation. Students who fail the OSSLT may re-take it or register to a literacy course instead.\n",
      "All publicly funded school boards must participate in the tests. Private schools and homeschooling parents may decide to opt in.\n",
      "EQAO also coordinates and administers Ontario’s participation in international tests such as PISA and TIMMS. Only a sample of Ontario’s students participate in these tests.\n",
      "EQAO results inform:\n",
      "Individual students and parents. Marks are mailed to students a few months after the test. Student do not receive information on right/wrong answers or any type of descriptive feedback.\n",
      "School boards and principals. Principals should use EQAO results to elicit feedback from the school council regarding the school improvement plan.\n",
      "EQAO research. EQAO uses the results to research into student achievement, school effectiveness, and best assessment practices.\n",
      "The Ministry of Education. In case of concern, the minister may use the EQAO results to order a review of a school board.\n",
      "Unofficially, EQAO results are used to rank schools. The Fraser Institute uses the publicly available information to create the “School Report Card” website. http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/ChooseReport.aspx\n",
      "ETFO voices a strong position against EQAO. Some of their main points:\n",
      "It has lead to overemphasis of math and literacy in schools to the detriment of all other subjects (science, social studies, arts, etc.)\n",
      "It creates too much pressure on students, teachers, and administrators.\n",
      "Teachers’ assessments are the most valid and reliable\n",
      "It is a waste of time and money that could be used more productively.\n",
      "ETFO has issued two advisories regarding EQAO; one informs teachers that the EQAO teacher questionnaire is voluntary, and urges teachers not to answer it; the other urges teachers to avoid taking jobs as markers of EQAO tests, as these tests are an “attack on the teaching profession”. NOTE: If members do not heed the advice provided by an advisory, they will not be subject to discipline.\n",
      "Teachers and principals are responsible for ensuring the fair and consistent administration of the assessments as outlined in the Administration Guide. Sample details in the administration guide include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The test is divided into 6 sections. Each section is one hour long with optional extension that must directly follow the allotted hour.\n",
      "For reading sections, teachers may not read the passages or the questions for the students.\n",
      "For other sections, teacher may only read the questions to students who request it, but must not translate, interpret, explain, suggest, or influence the student’s decisions in any way (e.g. drawing the student’s attention to an unanswered question).\n",
      "All classroom materials containing reading, writing or mathematics content of an instructional nature must be removed from view or covered.\n",
      "Any circumstances that may affect the scoring of student work (e.g., package ID number issues) or may have affected the validity of any student performance (e.g., a discussion between two students during the assessment) must be documented and reported to EQAO on the Issues Envelope.\n",
      "Accommodations are allowed only for students with IEP, except for special circumstances (e.g., the student is new to the school) and with the principal's approval. In any case, accommodations must be arranged in advance. Only accommodations listed in the accommodations guide are allowed. Accommodation categories are: setting (e.g., quiet space, prompter), time (e.g. supervised breaks), presentation format (e.g. assistive technology), and response format (e.g. scribing).\n",
      "ELL students who do not have an IEP are not eligible for accommodations, but are eligible for special provisions (e.g., quiet room, extra time)\n",
      "Teachers and administrators who do not follow the EQAO guidelines risk being charged with professional misconduct.\n",

      "8,640,3,On the spectrum between “Digital Immigrant” and “Digital Native”, I believe that I land quite close to “Digital Native”. I grew up in a house that was very computer-friendly – we had computers in the house very early – and I was able to play on them in my spare time and learn how to use them by trial-and-error. I rarely read instruction manuals nor did I use help menus, but rather I discovered computer programs on my own and used online help forums to boost my learning when needed. My intrinsic drive to become computer literate stemmed both from the desire to access higher and more complex technologies, and from the idea that discovery learning was the primary way – maybe even the only way – that people learned how to use new things. Because I was exposed to this method of learning early on and because of this way of thinking, I hypothesize that my brain has developed along similar lines of digital natives. I show signs of this in my “accent”. For example, I still feel a tendency to want to read documents in hard copy if I am reading a document for school, reading a book, or editing work.\n",
      "  I agree with Prensky that ideally, we would adapt all of our teaching to this new learning style. I especially appreciated Prensky’s mention of the “instantaneity” that “Digital Natives” are accustomed to in their everyday lives. I have thought for some time that it is unreasonable to ask students who are immersed in a culture of instant gratification to sit in a chair at school for 8 hours and learn in a way that is completely foreign (and boring) to them. However, I have to ask myself one burning question: is there a support system – resources, workshops, etc – for teachers who are willing and ready to do this in a realistic way? I stress the term realistic here because we have to remember that we work not only under time constraints but also a limited budget and limited school resources. I have little doubt that in an ideal world, teachers would be able and willing to cater to the “Digital Native” minds of their students, but it isn’t as simple as educating the next generation of teachers and sending them off into the world. Policies, structures, teaching norms exist, and we as future teachers are always combating against falling back into patterns of teaching that our own teachers used.\n",
      "  However, just because it is difficult to cater to these students, that doesn’t mean that we can’t. As pessimistic as this reflection may be, I look forward to being a part of the slow change towards discovery learning. I believe that the most realisitic way to enact this change will be to incoporate “critical thinking” principles in my teaching practice, which I have begun doing and plan to do in the future.\n",

      "  just wanted to let you know that there will be class tomorrow at 9. Those who are facilitating the next readings will stick to doing it on Monday.\n",
      "  See you tomorrow,\n",
      "8,642,1,  My first step upon learning that we had to read an article and respond to it was to print Prensky. I chuckled to myself as he explains having to print your e-mail or print a document in order to edit it as indicators, or as the “accent” of a ‘digital immigrant.’ Also amusing was watching my classmate start his assignment. He pulled the article up on line and was making all of his notes and comments in to the article with a digital tech format. Clearly a more efficient way of organizing his thoughts, but one that I would never think of, or know how to do.\n",
      "            Prensky defines a ‘digital native’ as those students k-12 who’ve spent their entire lives surrounded by all the toys and tools of the digital age. Growing up my family did not have cable, I hardly ever used our computer, and I didn’t have a cell phone until University. This was not due to economic realities, but a value judgment made by my parents and a total lack of interest and curiosity on my part. I always acknowledged that using digital tech was not my strength, but I didn’t see this as a disadvantage until I began the MT program.\n",
      "            I agree with Prensky’s argument that the arrival and rapid dissemination of digital tech has fundamentally changed things. He argues that as a result of the sheer volume of digital tech, and students interaction with it today’s students think and process information fundamentally differently; and because different kinds of experiences lead to different brain structures their brains may actually be physically different. Therefore it is imperative that the nature of education changes as well. I understand this means that I must teach in a way that is responsive to these students, by for example, teaching faster and less step-by-step. Although there are resources that explain how to implement specific pedagogical strategies, like the ‘writers workshop,’ there seems to be less detailed strategies for integrating technology. In order for a ‘digital immigrant,’ like myself, to incorporate technology I need to learn how in the way I learn best, slowly and methodically. For someone who has difficulty exploring new digital technologies, there should be resources to help guide this process.\n",
      "            I am not sure I buy Prensky’s argument that digital tech is the best way to teach all subject matter. He says he prefers teaching ‘digital natives’ through video games because it’s a means that most of them are totally familiar. He explains that Monkey wrench, a videogame designed to help engineers learn CAD software has been extremely successful, but his audience was almost exclusively male engineers between 20-30 years old. We don’t know if this technique would have been as successful with a different demographic, for example, a group of female historians.\n",
      "            In his “thought experiments” he invites professors and teachers to give him a subject or topic and he’ll invent a game or other ‘digital native’ method for teaching it. In response to “classical philosophy” he suggested a game in which philosophers debate and the learners have to pick out what each would say. This is fine, but this could only be done at the end of the learning. In response to the “holocaust” as a topic, he suggested creating a simulation where students role-play the meeting at Wannsee, but I don’t see why an old-fashioned role-play couldn’t be as effective. He also says that digital immigrants think learning can’t be fun, I think this assumption is incorrect and I do not think that digital technology necessarily makes learning ‘fun,’ or even more engaging.\n",
      "            It occurs to me that in my response and problems with Prensky I am just showing my reluctance to integrating technology, despite the fact that I acknowledge its importance. Although I cringe when I see an eight year old with an iPhone, because I am teaching a new generation I need to be what Prensky calls a ‘smart immigrant,’ one that accepts that they don’t know about their new world and take advantage of their kids to help them learn and integrate. And although I would label myself a ‘digital immigrant,’ and still have no desire to get many new digital tech tools, including the infamous iPhone, there are clearly parts of digital tech culture that I have embraced and that I acknowledge make my life much easier. For example, I am currently writing this paper aboard an airplane on my laptop. I reluctantly admit that I must continue to challenge myself and take risks with digital technology before I become “out of date” in the eyes of my students and my employers. ,\n",
      "8,644,1,Based on Prensky’s examples, I clearly identify as a digital native. I grew up with computer games since a very early age. I learnt much of my early English (as a native Hebrew speaker) through computer games. I started to learn some computer programming on my own at the age of 10. I studied computer engineering in university and worked in several hi-tech companies taking part in the development of new digital technologies, such as digital camera processors and multimedia mobile phones. Throughout my schooling and work I have preferred learning by random access and interactive trial and error, as opposed to slow , linear, step-by-step learning.\n",
      "  As a teacher, I disagree Prensky’s generalization that all young people are fluent in digital language. Children vary significantly in the amount and nature of their use of digital technology. In fact, I find that most students, despite being prolific user of technology, are not very proficient with it. They  use it narrowly and superficially. For example, I have worked with students who did not understand basic concepts such as creating folders and moving file between computers, despite spending much of their leisure time watching youtube videos and posting on facebook. I think it is important to teach students the skills related to using technology productively. We cannot assume that they know these skills simply because they were born in the 21st century.\n",
      "  I agree with Prensky that teachers need to go “faster, more random access, and less step-by-step”, although I am not sure it is a phenomena that is necessarily unique to the digital generation. Educational movements such as project based learning, inquiry based learning, experiential learning, which predate the digital age, have long argued that top-down, transmissive teaching was not effective for students. In my opinion, the main reasons for changing pedagogy is not that today’s learners are inherently different, but that technology provides us with the opportunity to provide meaningful and individualized learning experience on a massive scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not see this opportunity in the same way as Prensky though. Gamification of school subject should not be the main focus. Education in the 21st century should include more than technological competencies. It should also help learners develop Habits of Mind (Costa, 2008), such as persistence, listening with empathy, managing impulsivity, metacognition, and thinking interdependently. Developing such habits will not happen in environments that emphasize immediate gratification such as most computer games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, I believe we should focus on utilizing technology to develop learner driven, reflective, mastery oriented environments. Tools such as digital portfolios with a focus on process can encourage personalization of learning, reflection on learning, goal setting, and deliberate practice. Tools such as digital storytelling enable student to express themselves in richer ways a typical school writing assignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my disagreements with Prensky, I think his article has served as an important wake up call to educators. As a future teacher who is a proficient user and developer of digital technologies, I am excited to explore  the opportunities that access to digital technology presents to pedagogy.\n",

      "8,647,7,  It is interesting to note how quickly a paper written on technology can go out of date, as oppose to any other field of study out there.  While Prensky was able to discern the differences between a Digital Native and Digital Immigrant, such differences do not appear to be as apparent as they may have been eleven years ago, at least among teachers.  As far as I have seen in both my practicum placements, teachers (who can be labeled as Digital Immigrants) seem to have completely lost their “accents” with time.  Such “accents” are artifacts of prior experience, which Digital Natives do not have.  Is this necessarily a bad thing though?  Teachers must always be staying current, and up to date in their practice, but does being a Digital Immigrant as oppose to a Digital Native have anything to do with it?\n",
      "            Prensky seems to offer a general definition of Digital Natives as being those who have grown up with technology their whole lives (mostly “kids”), and Digital Immigrants as those who have been around before technology had become so mainstream, and had gotten into it later in their lives (mostly “older people”).  I think that these days, contrary to Prensky's elaboration on the definitions, it is harder to differentiate between the two based on technological skills alone.  The only defining line could be age, and even that is hard to generalize, because many children these days could be considered Digital Immigrants as well, myself included.\n",
      "            So, based on this concept, which could use some updating, it would be hard to place myself within one category because I was on the cusp of the digital revolution.  Perhaps I had not had a personal home computer or internet access until I was roughly twelve years old, which would make me a Digital Immigrant, but I have completely lost my “accent” and am still considered younger than the age Prensky regarded Digital Immigrants as being.  This would make me neither a Digital Immigrant nor a Digital Native, or indistinguishable at least.  However, had I needed to identify myself among one of these two extremes, which have much variance within their categories, I would lean closer to a Digital Native.  Many Digital “smart” Immigrant teachers (as Prensky coins them) would most likely label themselves as Digital Natives as well after so many years of exposure to technology, even though they are immigrants after all.\n",
      "            I don’t think that being a Digital Native or Digital Immigrant has many implications these days on their role as teachers as long as the teacher can make their teaching current and relevant.  Any teacher (Digital Native or Immigrant) can fall into old habits of teaching the ways they were taught, whether old fashioned or progressive, no matter how tech savvy they are.  Knowing does not always translate to doing; it is how you use this knowledge that counts. And, in modern times, one may have this knowledge as much as the other. “Digital Native” or “Digital Immigrant” labels should not be used to describe technical skill sets or fluency (as is implied in the Prensky article) beyond the definitions I have used in the second paragraph above, because both have the capabilities of being technologically \"current\".\n",
      "            Presky presents some points that are also quite valid today, mainly that teachers need to change their teaching methodology and content in order to fit the particular students they are teaching.  It is the teacher’s role to keep the Digital Native and Digital Immigrant students current and to speak to their experiences and prior knowledge in order to make the content relevant, by any means possible (whether it may include using technology or not).\n",
      " ,\n",
      "8,648,1,Hey Curtis, just to let you know, I think we are suppose to post the entire response as a message, not in a link.  Just a heads up!,\n",
      "8,649,1,While I agree with Prensky’s major premise (that ‘digital immigrant’-educators must work to meet the changing needs of digitally informed youth who learn differently and have different opportunities than they did), I question some of his assertions. The first is the implied notion that all those born into an age of ‘digital nativity’ are comfortable with, have access to and learn better through a digital medium.  Though I grew up with a computer, web access, learning software and games and computer courses, I am today far less ‘plugged-in’ than many of my peers. I think that this has been a result of learning that the way a lot of digital communication and learning happens isn't in line with how I learn and like to communicate.\n",
      "   I lack a great deal of the specific knowledge that would satisfy some definitions of what it means to be ‘digitally literate’. Students who grow up speaking and reading the same language achieve different levels of literacy. I may be more or less ‘digitally native’ than someone growing up in the same time and place as myself, because of difference in accessibility, ability and interest. I think this difference within cohort exists currently and will continue to exist. So, while we will definitely see more and more technology in all aspects of public education, I believe we also need to look at where the decision to not use technology may be beneficial. As the CEO of a software company, I’m sure Prensky would like to believe that all learners can benefit to a degree which justifies the pervasive use of technology for learning, but I am not yet convinced that is the case.\n",
      "   I have used technology in my teaching and could not imagine a tech-less classroom going forward, but I have also seen technology used to poor effect in my work as a language teacher, even when well thought out and well intentioned. Part of the failure came from student’s lack of interest in sitting in front of screens to learn, but a lot of it comes from teacher’s inability to use technology in a creative and interesting way that engages students and respects the level of understanding they have of technology. If you remember the terrible, outdated, low-fi 1970’s BBC productions of Macbeth and Lear that were shown to many students even in the 1990’s, you might see a parallel; if students are used to a certain quality of media in their personal lives, any attempt to use the same media that falls short is going to fail. So, with Prensky, I do believe that teachers should be thinking hard and making an effort to be creative with the use of technology. However, I also think that this is simply not the strength of some teachers. We can make it a duty for teachers to use technology, but it doesn’t mean they’re going to use it well, so it may defeat our purpose. I believe that a lot of great teaching can happen in a technologically-sparse environment, and that it’s going to take time for ‘digital natives’ to make up the majority of those in the teaching profession.\n",

      "8,651,1,When first discussing the concept of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants in class, I felt that I am much more of a Digital Native. This belief was influenced by the fact that my iPhone feels like an extension to my body and I find it difficult to remember a time when I wasn’t using a computer or the internet in school.  After reading and thinking more about Prensky’s article, I still feel more closely connected to the experiences of Digital Natives; however, I can now also see where I identify with some of the experiences of Digital Immigrants. I know that I have been heavily influenced and taught by Digital Immigrants throughout the majority of my education and many of their tendencies, dispositions and beliefs may have manifested within me as well. For example, when I read the quote, “Today’s average college grads have spent less than 5,000 hours of their lives reading, but over 10,000 hours playing video games,” I was shocked like many Digital Immigrants likely would be as well. It saddens me that many students today may not enjoy reading as much as I did as a child. I find it easiest to define my identity in comparison to others and where I believe they fit on the digital spectrum. To explain, I am much more of a Digital Native than my older sisters because I am accustomed to school life filled with computers, but I feel far less of a Digital Native than many of the students I have taught because I am adjusting to school life filled with smart phones and tablets and all of their capabilities.\n",
      "            My experience in writing this paper today in itself provides a window into my dual identity. As I write this paper, my Digital Native nature shines through because I am sitting in a Starbucks and drafting my paper on my laptop instead of by hand, and to find this Starbucks an hour ago I quickly pulled up Google maps on my iPhone while I simultaneously checked my iCalendar and texted a friend. However, I am extremely aware that I have not developed many of the skills or tendencies of Digital Natives that Prensky discusses like being able to “parallel process” or work at a faster speed while multitasking. My “accent” as a Digital Immigrant is evident right now in the fact that I need to print out a copy of my work to edit it. On a daily basis, I reconcile the skills I learned from Digital Immigrants in my schooling with the new opportunities that technology provides.\n",
      "            While my dual identity could positively affect my teaching, I am finding myself increasingly worried about my ability to keep up with my students and their rapidly developing “language.”  The thought that today’s students may “think and process information fundamentally differently from their predecessors,” including me, is both alarming and motivating. I find it alarming because of quotes in the article like, “[Digital Immigrants choose to teach] slowly, step-by-step, one thing at a time, individually, and above all, seriously.” That is certainly not how I want to teach, but I worry that I will because I might not actually have a true sense of who my students are (as pure Digital Natives) and how to best support them in their “language.” All that being said, the optimist in me finds the same quote motivating because I know that if I invest time and effort I can learn new technology quickly and apply it in my future classrooms.\n",
      "            I agree with Prensky that our educational system is not designed for today’s students, and I feel that change is due so I know I must be open and committed to keeping pace with what is best for my students. For example, while I have always envisioned my future classrooms being filled with books, I am now considering whether eBooks could be a better way to serve my students in the future.\n",
      "            Prensky says, “Is it that Digital Natives can’t pay attention, or that they choose not to? Often from the Natives point of view their Digital Immigrant instructors make their education not worth paying attention to compared to everything else they experience – and then they blame them for not paying attention!” After thinking about this, I have decided that the onus is on me to bridge the gap between my students and me and to ensure that my content and methodology reflects the lives and nature of my students. I realize that this will require addition investments in my professional development (i.e. learning more “future content” myself), so that I can teach in ways that work for today’s students.  As Prensky puts its, “going faster, less step-by step, more in parallel, with more random access” will likely be a challenge, but I believe it can revolutionize and energize my teaching.,\n",
      "8,653,6,Since the age of 7, I have spent much time using computers, videogames, digital music players, cellphones and the Internet. Technology has been especially important to me in terms of socializing – from chatting with friends on ICQ and MSN, to Facebook, and BBM and text messaging. More recently, Instagram has become a medium I use to interact with friends. From a young age, I have also felt that my writing flows better using a word processor than with pen and paper. I have had positive experiences using technology for academic purposes. Therefore, I identify with Prensky’s definition of a Digital Native.\n",
      "  Being immersed in technology from such a young age has shaped my use of technology and my values associated with using it in my social, academic and professional life. I am constantly “plugged in” to my Macbook and iPhone and believe in the benefits of technology (especially Apple products!). The value I place on technology in my personal life has transferred in to a belief in using technology as a tool for teaching.\n",
      "  I am continuously searching for new ways to use technology to best fit my personal needs. I integrate new applications easily into my personal routine. Most recently, I discovered the usefulness of the reminders app. This synchronizes my list of tasks on my cellphone and computer and I am able to set an alarm to remind me of individual tasks. Reminders has replaced my daily to do lists, which I used to write out on post-it notes. I feel that the practice of reflecting on my own use of technology will follow me into the classroom. Further, I am excited to learn about new technologies from peers, through blogs and discussions in the MT program.\n",
      "  For me technology’s efficiencies outweigh the “learning curve.” I feel that technology allows me to do everything more efficiently from planning and organizing to collaborating with peers (Google Docs and Facebook). I share my excitement of new technologies with my peers and encourage their use. When I am unsure of how to use an application, I often persevere and troubleshoot, whether that is through reading message boards or asking friends for help. My passion for technology has guided me to this topic for my MTRP and I am researching what experiences and beliefs shape teachers who integrate technology in their classroom.\n",
      "  Although I am a Digital Native, I disagree with Prensky’s firm definition of Digital Immigrant. He argues that as a Digital Immigrant learns, he or she adapts to the new environment but always retains a foot in the past (Prensky, 2001. P. 2). I believe Prensky is trying to argue that individuals who have not grown up surrounded by technology do not fully embrace technology, and still do many things “the old fashion way.” I feel that a more important predictor of how people use technology is their values, which they can develop later in life. My AT in her late 40s exemplifies this. She was technologically savvy because she valued technology. She explored the Internet for various applications of technology, used an iPad regularly and truly embraced technology for all the benefits it can offer both her and her students. She was able to integrate technology into her teaching effectively. I saw students engaged and feel as though their values were represented in her classroom.\n",
      "  In conjunction with my value of technology, I believe in teaching 21st century skills. Prensky complains that students today cannot learn the names, populations, capitals and relationships of all 101 nations in the world. I do not agree that students should be memorizing anything. As teachers we need to help foster 21st century skills such as creativity & innovation, communication, critical thinking & problem solving and collaboration. Memorization of facts is irrelevant in the age of the Internet.\n",
      "  I agree with Prensky that role of the classroom teacher needs to change in the 21st century. However, I disagree with the way he proposes it should change - in the form of \"edutainment\" I feel that technology can engage students when used in a meaningful way in the classroom – which is not necessarily “edutainment.” This is something I hope to learn more about in my MTRP. I hope that my experiences and values associated with technology will positively influence my use of technology in the classroom. I strongly believe that to make our teaching culturally relevant, we should be infusing our lessons with technology. ,\n",
      "8,654,7,       Marc Prensky’s Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants speaks directly to one of the most fundamental problems facing education today.  The term Digital Natives, Prensky suggests, describes the generation of students in schools from kindergarten through to grade twelve who see themselves as disconnected from teachers and a curriculum, which is “old school” in nature.  This “old school” mentality is used to describe the Digital Immigrants, who are foreign to new technology and less willing and perhaps less able to adopt its culture in their respective professional and personal lives.  The distinction between these two cultures, the Digital Immigrants and the Digital Natives, has great implications for me as a teacher entering the classroom in the 21st century.\n",
      "         Before effectively discussing the implications of this cultural divide for me as a teacher, it is important to establish where I see myself in this fragmented discussion of old versus new.  While I believe Prensky successfully articulates many of the critical problems, which arise from this cultural divide, I feel he only provides an arena of extremes in which we are asked to find a reflection of ourselves. However, I cannot honestly say that I identify exclusively as an immigrant or a native, instead I feel caught somewhere in the middle of this dichotomy.  In other words, while I am neither afraid of technology nor resistant to its increasingly active role in our various environments, it is also not intuitive for me.  Consequently, I feel that I belong in a different category, one that is not presented in this article but what might be coined as a first-generation native.\n",
      "         As I begin to think about the implications this will have on my teaching, I think back to my practicum experiences and my willingness to engage with technology in the classroom.  Based on my own upbringing with what today might be described as basic technology, such as a laptop as an integral part of my life, I cannot imagine teaching without some basic technological integration.  With that being said, I am motivated to pursue my own professional development to learn how to incorporate newer technologies such as SMART Boards and iPads into my teaching as the operation of these newer devices does not come intuitively to me the way they might for Digital Natives, nor do they alarm me the way they might the Digital Immigrants.\n",
      "         One thing that stands out to me as I reflect on Prensky’s paper is the limited access my students and associate teachers had to technology both in the classroom and for many students at home as well.  This limited access is not something that Prensky addresses in his article.  Rather, he assumes that all students have spent “their entire lives surrounded by and using computers, videogames, digital music players, video cams, cells phones, and all the other toys and tools of the digital age.”  Still, I think this paper is a great contribution to the discussion on technology and its role in the classroom.  Too often I find people use limited access as a mask for their own unwillingness to learn new technologies.  As teachers we must commit to our own professional development on effective technology integration in the classroom.  That commitment should stem from the responsibility we have to our students to ensure the learning in the classroom be as meaningful and relevant as possible.  By describing students today as those who “have little patience for lectures, step-by-step logic, and ‘tell-test’ instruction,” Prensky is convincing in his argument for more technology in the classroom coupled by a movement towards “adapting materials to the language of Digital Natives.”\n",
      "         Ultimately, in describing myself as a first-generation native, I feel I have had enough experience with technology embedded in my upbringing that I am able to approach new technologies willingly and with an open mind.  Prensky speaks to the need for reform in our school system as too many students are failed by the system that is in place today.  While I feel he neglects to address some of the limitations in moving towards the Digital Native way, I am optimistic that we are at the forefront of some major pedagogical changes that will ultimately lead to increased student engagement and therefore student success.\n",

      "8,655,2,  Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants – Personal Response\n",
      "                    This article echoes my belief that, over the last decade, a significant “generational gap” has developed between teachers and students in our education system. I have observed, from both the perspective of a student and of a teacher, a discernible disconnect between pedagogy and student engagement, between curriculum content and meaningful learning, between teachers and students. Prensky’s article, Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, attributes this gap to the arrival and growing accessibility of digital technology; this “singularity” has changed the fundamental way in which children of the 21st century socialize, communicate, think, process information, and learn (Prensky, 2011). Prensky likens many teachers to immigrants in this digital world – foreigners who fail to understand the progressive language and culture of the Digital Natives, our students, and, ultimately, fail to teach effectively.\n",
      "                    Prensky points out distinct differences in Digital Immigrant teachers’ “outdated”, traditional pedagogy and the needs of our Digital Native students. Multi-tasking, parallel processing, access to visuals, instant gratification, and experiential interactions are but a few of the necessary components that contribute to a Digital Native student’s learning and level of engagement (Prensky, 2011). In order for Digital Immigrant teachers to meet the needs of our students, we must acknowledge our professional inadequacies, develop understandings of new instructional approaches that engage our students, integrate new methodologies in our pedagogy, and continue to reflect and improve as educators. Prensky suggests that we must modify our pedagogy by moving away from “step-by-step” instruction and allowing our students to approach curriculum content from a “big-picture” perspective. I believe that we need to provide our students with more freedom in their learning. We must reflect this in our teaching practices by providing students with opportunities to explore content holistically, learn experientially, focus on process over product, and demonstrate their learning in a variety of ways.\n",
      "                    As I reflect on my experiences as a teacher candidate, I can understand the undertones of urgency in Prensky’s article. During one of my teaching practicums, I incorporated Powerpoint and SmartBoard technologies in many of my math lessons. The lessons that I designed involved hands-on problem solving, group work, and extensive discussion between students. I was astonished to see the level of excitement and appreciation that the students expressed – it had been the first time that year that they experienced a lesson that incorporated technology, as well as instruction differing from traditional “chalk and talk”. I continued to develop engaging and experiential math lessons and was pleased to observe high levels of engagement, learning, and understanding from the students. Contrastingly, the literacy lessons that I taught did not prove to be as successful. It was my first time teaching literacy and my unfamiliarity with the subject was revealed in my lesson plans. Upon reflection, the language lessons I delivered were rigidly-structured and teacher-driven, leaving little room for student involvement, collaboration, and exploration of content. Why did the design and effectiveness of my lessons vary so dramatically? Relating my teaching experience to Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, I believe I can attribute the successes and failures of my lessons to the pedagogy behind them. My math lessons allowed for students to think critically and to take command of their learning – they didn’t require mastery of content prior to engaging in lesson activities. Rather, the students learned key concepts through experience and discussion with classmates. On the other hand, the literacy lessons I delivered were structured from “bottom to top”; mechanics and form were emphasized before student opportunities to express their views and engage in meaningful discussions.\n",
      "                    It is apparent that teachers need to let go of “traditional” teaching values and accept that our students require pedagogy that embraces their culture, learning style, and “language”. This article was particularly interesting to me because I had always thought that my generation could serve as a “bridge” between the children of today and the generation before me. I feel that my peers and I had the privilege of growing up with much of the present technologies, albeit not to the same extent of today’s youth, but with enough familiarity to embrace and smoothly transition into new digital developments. I see the role of my generation, especially embodied through the position of an educator, as an important one. We have the base knowledge and understanding of digital technology, as well as the cultural and social implications that come with it. My generation of teachers will have an opportunity to capitalize on this knowledge to better engage our students and provide them with rich learning opportunities that embraces their way of thinking.\n",

      "8,656,3,     Today’s world, especially the way in which society operates, is completely different from years past. Though technology has existed in our world for many years, the constant advancements in technology, which seem to be advancing at an unprecedented rate, have created a society that moves at a pace in which it is difficult to keep up! Evidently, these technological advancements continue to impact all areas of work and play, and of living, in general. In particular, the education system has undergone and continues to undergo some drastic changes, manipulating and tailoring the practices of educators and students.\n",
      "       Prensky states that, “today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach”. The author discusses that these new students, or Digital Natives, are born into the digital world and live and breathe technology, whereas Digital Immigrants are those individuals who have taken up bits and pieces of novel technology after birth and later on in life, slowly adjusting the way in which they do things. I appreciate Prensky’s classifications of the dichotomy.\n",
      "       In reflecting on this article, it is difficult for me to fully identify with either a Digital Native or a Digital Immigrant, and therefore, I believe that I am a mixed breed of the two. From my earliest memories at Montessori school, I do not recall ever using computers or even seeing computers in the classroom. I do recall a PC computer in my basement, which I did not use until I was about five years old, and when I did use it, which was not very often at all, I recall playing two computer games, McGee and Mickey Mouse. I do remember feeling that the computer was a very special privilege since it was different from the rest of my toys and games.\n",
      "          During my intermediate years, I recall going to computer class where I learned some basic but necessary skills such as how to use the keyboard, and eventually, how to use the Internet. In high school, I began using computers much more frequently and teachers began expecting students to submit most assignments in typed format. Throughout university, technologies (i.e. computers, laptops, smartphones, online learning modules, clickers, etc.) have been an integral part of my education and lifestyle. However, I do take pride in taking handwritten notes, attending face-to face lectures, and enjoying some traditional teaching.\n",
      "       It is fascinating to learn that the brain structures of today’s students are different from those students in the past, including myself. Even more captivating is how thinking has changed and how our reliance on technology is so much greater today than it has ever been. As teachers, we often teach based on what we know and how we have come to learn what we know. I think Prensky is correct when he explains that some Digital Immigrant educators are not only speaking “an outdated language” to their Digital Native students, but they are also resistant to change. I empathize with them as a part of me is a Digital Immigrant, and I find it difficult to change my habits and the approaches of teaching and learning that I grew up with. At times, I find technological advancements overwhelming, frustrating, and distracting, but this does not stop me from pursuing and adapting to technological advancements.\n",
      "       Prensky seems to put importance on learning through technological games. I find computer games, whether they are for learning purposes or not, to be unsatisfying. Learning should be fun but it should not always be associated with playing games. There exist arrays of technological advancements that enhance learning and can capture the attention of Digital Natives, and Prensky should address these to be on an equal playing field as computer games. For my own classroom, I hope to discuss with my students, their individual learning needs and inquire about their access and comfort with technology. It is not fair to assume that all students will have equal access to technology nor is it right to assume that they are all equally comfortable with the Digital Native lifestyle. These are some issues that Prensky fails to address.\n",
      "       Prensky is convincing in his discussion on how Digital Natives have minimal patience for traditional teaching practises. As a soon-to-be teacher and a mixed breed, it is important for me to understand the diverse needs of my Digital Native students and how their needs will likely not be the same as mine. In saying this, by the time I am a teacher, there will most likely be novel technological advancements in which I will need to develop fluency so that I can not only connect with my students but also provide them with a learning environment in which they see themselves reflected and therefore, have more of an opportunity to excel.\n",

      "              Reflecting on my elementary and secondary school years I realize that my childhood experiences differ significantly from those of today’s youth. For the majority of my elementary years the only forms of technology I utilized were television and the home phone.  These technologies were moderately monitored by my parents and thus they never became problematic for me. I preferred to spend my free time playing outdoors with my sister and friends, reading a good book, or playing with my toys. My family’s first home computer did not arrive until I was in grade six. Without Internet connection the computers sole purpose in my home was to allow me to print assignments. This was always a very time consuming task as the printer took approximately 25 minutes to print a single page! High school brought access to new and better technologies. During this time I was also given my first cell phone, had access to high speed Internet and began to use my computer to watch videos, listen to music and chat with friends online on MSN.\n",
      "            My experiences with technology definitely identify me as a Digital Immigrant. Although I was not born into a digital world my comfort with technology continues to increase. Over the years technology has gained a more prominent role in my day-to-day functioning. Today, I cannot leave home without my iPhone, a device I use not only for talking, chatting, and Internet browsing but also as a GPS, translator and camera. I like to think of myself as an ever learning Digital Immigrant with a slight accent, obvious when I still need to print documents in order to read or edit them.\n",
      "            As a teacher I am aware that my upbringing and experience with technology will be remarkably different than that of my students.  As a result of these differences, the education system and specifically my teaching style and my approach must coincide with the interests and needs of present students. According to Prensky (2001) Digital Natives are accustomed to receiving instant information, enjoy multi-tasking and “prefer games to ‘serious’ work” (p. 2). In my opinion the learning style of any student should never be questioned but rather accepted, respected and embraced. This ideology is not exclusive to the digital natives we will find in our own classrooms. I am aware that my own identity, that of a Digital Immigrant, may potentially impact my role as a classroom teacher. In order to reach and teach my students effectively I must understand that although my personal educational experience was effective for me, that same approach will probably not work with my own students. I must aim for a constructivist approach, where students actively participate, have the opportunity to multi-task, and use technology to explore as well as demonstrate their learning. I agree with Prensky (2001) that we as teachers do not have to reinvent the wheel but we must adapt materials to the language of the digital natives in our classroom.\n",
      "            Identifying that my learning experience was strikingly different from that of my future students is the first step in moving towards a teaching approach that will better meet their needs. At times a personal reluctance to incorporate technologies might tempt me to rely on the teaching styles I was exposed to as a child. Partly this might be due to a fear of being humiliated for not knowing “easy technology” as a result of insufficient training or pressing time constraints. I realize however that what worked for me will probably not work for today’s student population. They are the drivers of technology today and my role will be to work with them to improve their learning experience. ,\n",
      "8,659,5,As a fourteen year old boy in 2001, had I read Marc Prensky's published article: \"Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants\", I would have identified with being a digital native. I used the internet, had a cell phone, a CD player, used Napster to download music, played video games and used ICQ to talk to friends. Today I would identify myself as a digital immigrant due to the constant advancement of technology and feeling out of the loop with newer forms of technology. Cell phones have multiple functions including texting, picture taking and internet surfing. CD players have become obsolete as iPods provide users access to thousands of songs in the palm of their hand. Some of these digital technologies I have been able to master quite easily (iPod, Laptops), but there are many others (iPad) that I am still learning how to use. Furthermore, there are some new technologies that I had not heard of until very recently (i.e. edmodo). Although I am still tech savvy and I am able to adapt to newer forms of technology, I feel that I am (and will continue to be) a digital immigrant.\n",
      "  Marc Prensky writes  that \"today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach\" (Prensky, 2001, p. 1). While this is true, the educational system will never be able to catch up to today's students. Digital technology will continue to progress and older forms of technology will become obsolete. Teachers will have trouble adopting technology into the classroom. Prensky says that \"our Digital Immigrant instructors, who speak an outdated language (that of the pre-digital age), are struggling to teach a population that speaks an entirely new language.\" (Prensky, 2001, p. 2), I do not believe that this is completely due to a misrepresentation of how students learn. Given that technology is constantly changing so fast and so quickly, teachers do not have the proper time to learn, assess, consider, and adopt technology into the classroom to its full potential. Teachers will always continue to struggle as they are immigrants in a native world.\n",
      "   As an upcoming teacher I feel that adopting technology into the classroom will have its challenges. Some schools may have digital technologies that are cutting edge and extremely current. These technologies will take time and effort for me to learn properly and efficiently. There are other schools that are limited in their technological usage and thus I may be required to use old-fashioned methods. This presents an issue since, according to Prensky, today's students learn differently than they did years ago. Even though students may \"like to parallel process and multitask\" (p. 2), I may not have the tools to maximize the learning needs of the students  Both of these scenarios are compounded by the fact that as a new teacher, I still have to find my place and establish the teacher that I want to be.\n",
      "  However, even though I feel that I am digital immigrant, I hope to use technology as a way to both engage my students and teach the curriculum in a more effective way. Prensky states that digital immigrant teachers are reluctant to incorporate technology into the classroom. If the technology is available to use and students are using these new technologies, teachers should also keep up with the times as well. Despite feeling like a digital immigrant, I want to reach out the natives so I can optimize the learning needs of all of my students. There will be the challenge of not being an expert at new cutting edge technology, but if I am teaching to a native world, then it is important for me to not be afraid of making mistakes. Just like the students, I have to learn as well. In some cases, the teacher may learn from the students.\n",
      "   While Prensky presents us with the ideal scenario of how to teach today's students, I unfortunately think that this high standard is unattainable. However, I am hopeful that teachers today recognize the value that technology brings to the classroom. Teachers have the ability to use technology in incredible ways to help contribute to the teaching process. While teachers will always be considered immigrants, hopefully we can strive to be like the natives.\n",

      "8,660,8,       As one of the youngest students in my MT cohort, I believe my school years are somewhat consistent with the technological experiences students encounter in today’s digital world. I recall growing up in a fast paced environment, where signing out resources from the library was becoming more and more uncommon as information was readily available with the click of a button. In other words, I was born into the world where the Digital Native phenomena already existed. In elementary school, I recall having weekly classes where my peers and I would go to the school computer lab to learn basic computer skills such as browsing the Internet, word processing and e-mail. While considering Prensky’s view in his article Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants (2001), I can see how many teachers fail to recognize that today’s students learn and process information differently. In regards to my own experiences, Prensky (2001) offers valid insight into ways teachers can better know and understand their students. Educators must acknowledge that students are permanently plugged into a network of digital devices, bringing the world to their fingertips in a way no previous generation has ever experienced. Currently, exploring basic computer skills and functions in school are mindless activities for most students whom already spend countless hours on the computer or playing video games at home. Reflecting back on my past experiences, many students were more technologically literate than their teachers, as such I can only begin to imagine the discontinuity that must exist in today’s classrooms.\n",
      "         Today, students are born with an innate aptitude for technology that Digital Immigrants can only dream of. For some educators, this instills fear that perhaps students have become incapable of paying attention or run the risk of being “more capable” than their teacher. The Internet creates a new world of accessibility, and as a result, students have quick and easy access to “information” as do their educators. Many people argue that knowledge is “power”. Are Digital Immigrants afraid that students hold the same resources as they do? Personally, I believe the incorporation of technology in schools allows students to become active participants in the learning process. Ownership is no longer the responsibility of the teacher but rather students have the resources to take control. Although it is evident that students know more about various technologies than their teachers, I believe teachers must embrace these opportunities for students to become more empowered in the learning process. When students have the opportunity to excel in a particular area, students gain a strong sense of self-esteem and self-efficacy. Furthermore, if students are likely engaged and motivated to learn using technology; why would educators enforce “traditional” forms of learning that prevent student engagement? The minds of students are wired differently such that they process information quickly and require more hands-on interaction with digital devices. Rather than blame technology for why students “learn” differently, educators must acknowledge its benefits and embrace various technological tools as a means to accommodate all students. Technology has the ability to improve our education system such that teachers become facilitators of learning, rather than “carriers of knowledge”.\n",
      "         Personally, I consider myself a Digital Native because I have grown up with technology as my main source for communication. However, technology is readily changing such that being yesterday’s Digital Native implies that my aptitude for technology is outdated. Luckily, I have witnessed the evolution of several technologies such that I may begin to critically analyze what new technologies will exist in the future. Students need to be given the opportunity to expand their thinking and ponder ways in which technology will continue to advance. They need to recognize that they are apart of a technological continuum such that one day current forms of technology will become obsolete. Although current students are today’s Digital Natives, they will become tomorrow’s Digital Immigrants.\n",
      "                 Today, educators are competing with the latest technological tools that stimulate students far beyond the elements of the “traditional” school setting. As such, educators are forced to change their instructional strategies to include ways in which students can more readily process and think. New technologies lead the way for new educational practices. It is a vicious cycle in which educators must always be ready to alter their practice as new technologies become more readily available. ,\n",
      "8,661,1,  According to Marc Prensky’s article “Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants”, Digital Natives are students who are “native speakers” of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet (1). Prensky defines Digital Immigrants as those who “learn” – “like all immigrants, some better than others – to adapt to their environment, they always retain, to some degree, their “accent,” that is, their foot in the past” (2). He further describes Digital immigrants as being older or “socialized” differently from their kids (Digital Natives), and “are now in the process of learning a new language” (2). The premise of Pensky’s concepts are that: “students have changed radically. Today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach.(1)”\n",
      "  Personally, I find it challenging to identify with the poles that Pensky outlines in his article. As a student in elementary school, I used technology throughout my classes; a large part of my private school education was centered on technology and innovation. As I went through grade school and University, I have become increasingly fluent in digital technology - both in my professional and personal life. Essentially, I fall under the category of a Digital Native, according to Prensky’s definition, yet I do not believe that all technology or constant use of it is an asset to personal growth or an indicator of all future success of students.\n",
      "  Prensky sets up a binary, an us versus them mentality of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, as if Digital Immigrants are somehow pedagogically insignificant.  It is logical that those who did not use technology during their early developmental stages may lack fluency or ease of use, depending on their exposure to technology, the idea that this somehow relates to the element of fun or engagement in a classroom is inherently flawed. The most engaging teachers I’ve had used empathy and humour to create a connection and build engagement - not technology.  Of course technology is an asset and a valuable tool, but the rhetoric that Prensky utilizes is really problematic throughout the article.\n",
      "Ultimately, I understand and believe that my use of technology assists students to build familiarity and strength taking risks with new modes of information and literacy, however, research has shown that the impact of increasing technology is an inherent problem with overstimulation. ADHD difficulties have been linked to overuse of technology, while studies show that mindfulness or outdoor education can be very beneficial, both for emotional well being and focus (Coughlan & Blakely, 2012). For my future classroom, differentiation has such a large part my purpose and design for using technology to stimulate student learning.\n",
      "  The fundamental gap in Prensky’s article seems to be the idea that technology’s main asset is speed.  I felt that Prensky’s article privileged the fast paced video game style teaching, which seems to be based on instantly gratifying speed or constant novelty. I think this underestimates the depth of critical and emotional thinking students are capable of - which is a cornerstone of my philosophy and vision of teaching. Technology, whether used creatively, repetitively in a detail-oriented or data gathering way, should focus on using the skill-set of the individual student. It is true that technology is fast, but it is not always gratifying on a more spiritual or fundamental level. I think that being cognizant of the weaknesses as well as the strengths of using technology - both as students and teachers - are the basis of our successful use of it.\n",

      "  I have a difficult time subscribing to either a digital native or a digital immigrant. When I think of digital immigrant, I think of my father, face down, parallel to the keyboard, typing with his pointer finger at a record high of 20 words per minute, or my mother who still uses her cell phone that does not even have a camera on it (gasp). As for the digital native, I think of my brother, a mere 5 years younger than I am, who has had a lap top since he was in grade 6 and can hook up his computer to the television without a detailed list of instructions and colour coded wiring tips. As for me, I reside somewhere in the middle; I will call myself a digital citizen.\n",
      "I remember getting my very first family computer; I remember the sound of dial-up Internet and having an additional phone line installed just to explore on the amazing World Wide Web. Though I was still very young when I had my first encounters with technology, I was not born out of the womb with apple device in my hand like the present day digital natives.  I think being a digital citizen, however, gives me a “one up” as a teacher in the classroom. I appreciate the traditional chalk and talk classroom because much of my elementary and middle school years were just that. However, witnessing the digital boom and being fortunate enough encounter its usefulness in the classroom in my later high school and university years, I have seen both worlds and know what each has to offer.\n",
      "Being this sort of digital citizen, as I have called it, I have the opportunity to impart knowledge onto my students while remaining open minded and willing to infuse new technologies into my teaching. In other words, I have the opportunity to learn from my students’ different modes of technologically that best suit them or that interest them and figure out ways how integrate that into the curriculum. As a digital citizen, I have the open-mindedness where the digital immigrant would otherwise display reluctance and I have vulnerability that the digital native would otherwise display the inability to scaffold and instruct step by step.\n",
      "The benefit of the immigrant is that he has the ability to teach “slowly, step by step, one thing at a time, individually, and above all, seriously” (2). This ability still has its place in the classroom where no two students are alike and learn at different paces. However, for the students in the class “who have been networked most or all of their lives” (3), teachers need to be adequately equipped to occupy their attention with what Prensky refers to as “edutainment”, a fusion of education and entertainment.\n",
      "Prensky recommends that in order to blur the line between the natives and the immigrants, in order to successfully teach our digitally native students, we must use our students as our guides. Being a digital citizen, I have the benefit of seeing the pro’s of the traditional classroom and the new age classroom which will undoubtedly inform how I teach and approach my own classroom.,\n",

      "              I find myself struggling with identifying with being either a digital native or that of a digital immigrant.  I feel as though I grew up in a time when technology was present, however the focus of my education and/or personal life was not on the technologies themselves.  I feel as though we are now living in an age of technology. The way we communicate, create, collaborate, is reliant on the developing technological world.  As a student, from what I can recall, the technological integration in my classrooms began in grade 5.  We were given a weekly class on a program called “All the Write Type,” which allowed us to learn how to type on a keyboard.  It wasn’t until the seventh grade, and only be virtue of the specialized arts program that I was in, that I was exposed to technology on a daily basis.  The program is called CyberARTS, where we had an emphasis and extra classes in visual arts as well as in digital arts, such as animation, website building, digital portfolio creation, and so on.  I was a part of this program from grade 7 through to grade 12.  Although this program allowed me to become well versed in many computer programs such as Adobe Photoshop and other Adobe software, Flash, Dreamweaver, etc, I was not introduced to many other technological devices.  However, the ability to use computers as well as video equipment on a daily basis has impacted my views as not only a student, but as a teacher, in terms of how I will go about exposing students to technology and allowing them to be immersed in it.\n",
      "            Although I see my younger self, and even parts of my current self, as a Digital Immigrant, I find myself connecting more and more with the Digital Natives.  I consider myself a Digital Immigrant because I am hesitant to use certain technologies due to my lack of knowledge and confidence in the material.  Yet, I find that today’s students are well versed in all varieties of technology and in order to make our teaching relevant, we need to tap into their technological minds.  It is not that I am as deterred from using technology as Prensky states Digital Immigrants are, I just lack the confidence to include such technologies.  However, I suppose you could say that as an adult, I am a Digital Native.  My entire experience in the MT program has promoted technological integration and has demonstrated how I, as a teacher, could integrate technology within the classroom.  Although I am being introduced to these new ways of integrating technology across the curriculum, I feel as though I myself will unfortunately not implement them as much as I would like.  This is not a reflection of my understanding of the use of some the technologies available, but has a direct connection with my lack of confidence and in my fear of technology consuming the classroom.  I fear that a lot of the traditional teaching methods, that I have witnessed to be successful, will disappear.  I think that it is important to acknowledge the benefits of technology, and because our students are so directly immersed in this new world, we as teachers need to be conscious of this.  If our teaching is to be relevant, which we are all striving for, then we need to include technology.  However, teachers need to be further educated, including myself, on how to use such technologies within our own classroom, whilst still being able to implement teaching methods that we are more comfortable with.  Overall, I think Prensky makes an extremely strong and relevant point in exposing the importance of the use of technology to further connect with our students and the changing ages.  He also quite clearly and effectively states the ‘defiance’ of Digital Immigrants in terms of using technology.  It is now up to new teachers, like myself, to break this divide. ,\n",
      "8,666,1,  Personal Response to Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants by Marc Prensky\n",
      "  As an elementary school student, I found my experiences to lack relevance and real world application. I was uninterested in copying from my history textbook to lined paper, and more interested in instant messaging or reading online blogs. During my junior years, any research assignment took weeks, as instructions were to find information through offline resources such as books and magazines. The same assignment could have taken a quarter of the time by using online search engines. I was living in a world that was rapidly evolving through technological advances. Students tended to these changes by experimenting with new programs and gadgets; however, education, on the other hand, disregarded the societal changes by leaving its system virtually unchanged.\n",
      "  Marc Prensky begins his article by revealing that the education system is amid decline. This comes as a result of the system’s shortcomings to making teaching relevant and useful within society. Prensky explains, “Today’s students are no long the people our educational system was designed to teach.” (2001) Students are growing up with a dependence on technologies such as the Internet, cell phones and instant messaging. Since this is the first generation to grow up with the new technology, Prensky labels them as “Digital Natives”. While “Digital Natives” are familiar and comfortable with new technologies, those that are were not born into the technology age struggle with modeling this approach in the classroom. Prensky differentiates teachers from “Digital Natives” as he explains that they are less confident and trusting with technology. He identifies these people as “Digital Immigrants”.\n",
      "  I didn’t think I was a “Digital Immigrant”. After reading Prensky’s article, I was disappointed to learn that many of my technological habits are in fact accents of a “Digital Immigrant”. While I may have signs of an accent, I do not fall under the generalizations made by Prensky. He argues that, “Digital Immigrant teachers don’t believe their students can learn successfully while watching TV or listening to music, because they can’t” (2001). Since I was growing up during the early developments of the digital age, I find myself more open to the idea that “Digital Natives” learn and communicate differently than others. Throughout the article, I found that Prensky was outdated in describing education, as the changes he promoted in methodology and content have already been put well into motion.\n",
      "  Prensky argues that teachers must start by teaching to students as \"Digital Natives\", yet he admits to uncertainty in how to teach logic. While this article is innovative in transforming the entire system of teaching and education, this argument is completely flawed. One must know what they are teaching, and how they will achieve learning. Prensky’s methodology consists of technology integration and hoping for the best outcome. A methodology of teaching “Digital Natives” must have clear and achievable goals and purposes. Secondly, Prensky’s view of dividing content as “Legacy” and “Future” juxtaposes what he perceives as good and evil. This is problematic as both “traditional styles of learning” and new age learning must be integrated and used collaborately. By labeling one as “Legacy” it tells students that this is old and useless, whereas, identifying content with technology as “Future” is inaccurate and amplifies its usefulness to an exaggerated and unbalanced degree.\n",
      "  In summary, Marc Prensky is innovative in his plea for a new paradigm towards teaching. While I agree with the fact that teaching must progress with the changes in society; I find that this article falls short as reduces the value of traditional education and the abilities of students. ,\n",

      "     I am reluctant to categorize myself as either a digital native (DN) or digital immigrant (DI) when I so fundamentally disagree with the reductionist nature of Prensky's theory. How can any generation be painted with the same brush based solely on age? The article ascribes to all students an equal, immediate proficiency with digital technology, and to their teachers a homogeneous inability to update their teaching methods. A cursory Internet search yielded several studies exploding this binary, reinforcing my initial distaste for its claims. I also object to the analogy made between digital technology and natural language, since a logical extension would conceive of ELL students as having fundamentally different brains from the English-speaking population: an absurd and insulting notion1.\n",
      "   However ill-defined the distinction between them, the two groups may nonetheless serve as useful stand-ins for other practical concerns faced by teachers; e.g. how do we differentiate instruction to serve students with different learning needs? Fundamentally, the difference between a DN and a DI is one of comfort with technology, which might be best framed as a continuum of access in general. Some people find digital technology more readily accessible, owing to a multitude of factors2, and it is this spectrum of variability that I hope to address equitably and effectively in my teaching practice, perhaps especially since I conceive of myself as a DN.\n",
      "   My childhood and adolescence afforded frequent and diverse exposure to digital technologies. When I was seven, an uncle gave me a home-constructed PC as a gift, and as the years went by, I watched the memory capacity and processing speed of my home computer increase exponentially. I used digital technologies (including online bulletin board systems) consistently in and out of the classroom, and in high school took a computer science class that covered the basics of Pascal. In short, I had access to digital technology throughout my developing years, and I explored it in ways that appealed to me; it was culturally positioned as both lifestyle tool and potential career.\n",
      "   Though I did not choose to pursue computer science professionally, it was only because I developed a conceptual understanding of digital technology that I could make that an educated choice. I know that most aspects of a career as a programmer or coder do not appeal to me; this does not make me a digital immigrant any more than my lack of interest in the specifics of telephone wiring. Would Prensky argue that anyone who uses a microscope or piano should be able to assemble one? I am not a digital native due to any specialized programming skills; I am a digital native by virtue of being at ease with many different technological modalities, and being able to mobilize all the resources at my disposal to access and evaluate unfamiliar technological formats.\n",
      "   When it comes to student disengagement and inertia, the alleged digital immigrants quoted by Prensky seem to be repeating timeless teacher complaints. Is it fair to pin it all on technology when there are myriad other factors at play? Conversely, are such problems solvable using technology alone? Why not also consider simulations, sport, art, or other modes of differentiated instruction?\n",
      "   To me, it doesn't seem occupationally or philosophically useful to conceive of one generation as being fundamentally different from another, when divergence within a group can far outstrip any demonstrable difference between groups. What is most important to account for and assess is each student's individual comfort level with technology.\n",
      "   I conceptualize technological literacy as part and parcel of critical inquiry. By encouraging my students to examine the scientific and cultural processes at work behind current digital technology, I will empower them to investigate future technologies that have not yet been developed. As there is no way we can stay on top of all current technological trends, we must set the stage for a fluidity of approach that transcends simplistic ideas of fluency. My students will be flexible and resourceful in adapting and teaching new technologies but, more importantly, they will continually refine their understanding of technology's importance and impact, using modes of critical inquiry. That is what a digital native does, accent or no.\n",

      "              Prensky talks about the evolution of the student, one moving away from pencils and books, and ‘learning’ to a student of games, of electronics and ‘fun’.  A student that has instantaneous needs and wants, and that those needs and wants, trumps, or is more important on a personal level that that of anything education could currently accomplish, or at least accomplish at the time of writing.  To this, I want to throw Prensky’s theory out the window and wonder if he is viewing students/youth as simply an observation, as a scientist views a mouse inside a cage.  This article has infuriated me, not only for its view on students and of youth, but also the approach to technology as a life-choice rather than a tool with its own challenges and privileges, and lastly on the dichotomy he creates between ‘traditional’ learning and ‘modern/digital native’ learning.\n",
      "            As a youth-worker and as an educator, I am absolutely appalled on his interpretation of students as being only part of a ‘twitch’ age, where everything is given to them quickly, and that as such that is all that they are connected to, this hyper-fast form of information receiving and giving.  Well, though it may be true that students do operate within systems of instantaneous connection, this isn’t all true as firstly not all have access (to be discussed when I address technology), but also that this type of information sharing and giving is in response to a larger system.  Almost all of the technologies that he mentions (YouTube, MTV, cell-phones) are predominately a form of entertainment, of such entertain is usually a disconnection, a way of getting away from the outside world.  Why are youth engaged is this entertainment technology then Prensky? Possibly because the world in which they live in has become quite large, and that there has been little discussion about what this means, and how students can interact with it for a greater and broader understanding. Does this mean that we should only interact with students at an entertainment (thus…edutainment) level? NO!  Students are willing and wanting, and can be engaged with curricular topics (including his dreaded ‘reading’) if we present with them an ability to have a dialogue with texts, that allow them to own their experiences, and relate seemingly ‘un entertaining’ texts to their own selves.  The answer is not to use entertainment to give them the information (thus perpetuating the ‘teach, test’ strategy Prensky seems to hate so much), but rather to address technology as a tool to help bridge that dialogue and that understanding of self and curricular matters.\n",
      "            The aspect of technology and changing access to, is also an important one.  These days, new updates, new technology is constantly becoming available (Five years ago, iPads did not exist, now there are three generations of), at an alarming rate.  There is a demand, not just for technology sake, but also as a capitalist stake to constantly be producing, and updating.  This issue is one that schools face in the form of funding (If everything is changing, how do we give them the new and best?), but also, how are we expected to keep up with all of this technology, and be able to ‘edutain’ students with it, if it’s constantly changing around them.  Furthermore, though software and games change, learning and dialoguing with the world, true learning, and what I want students to take out of education (an ability to understand, adapt to, and question the world around them), does not.  To base our education, around edutainment that changes every few weeks, every few months is ridiculous and harming not only our teaching practice but also our students.   What do we do if the edutainment no longer interests them? Our lessons are ruined, and we may not be able to go forwards or backwards, something that Prensky frets about in his article himself.  Where as If we use technology as a tool to engage, and to encourage dialogue, discussion and learning, not as the medium of which to do it by, we can adapt, and grow, but still keeps the message and meaning.\n",
      "            Also, though I know it is being used as a metaphor by Prensky, and that to him the term “Native” and “Immigrant” may seem like a useful way of describing those ‘born into’ a technological age, and those not, I feel that his use of the words ‘accent’, ‘Native’ and ‘immigrant’ are very loaded from a social-studies perspective, and I cringe each time I read one being used in that way.  Especially in his implications that those with ‘accents’ behave or do not behave in certain beneficial ways, and that in using this word that people with language, or cultural accents behave in similar ways, through linguistical association.\n",

      "  I am technologically illiterate. From my family’s first computer, 15 years ago, to my new shiny Macbook Pro, I never took an interest in exploring the cyber world. However, the quote above really resonates with me. I understand the importance of teaching to our students in a way that is relevant, accessible, and engaging. Although I do see many reasons to incorporate technology into my teaching, I can also identify some problems. Throughout this reflection I, a digital immigrant, will address the implications that occur in our diverse school systems.\n",
      "  While reading this article one point seemed to jump out at me, our students think and process information in different ways. They can access information through the touch of a button and interact socially through technology. Consequently, they need to learn different skills in order to function positively in society. In the article, Prensky states that today’s students have grown up in a radically different way; as a result, their brains have physically changed. In order to teach effectively to compliment this new way of learning, I must learn to incorporate technology.\n",
      "  While complimenting this new way of learning, teachers who incorporate technology are also relating to their students, informing them in ways that are relevant to their world. At the end of the day many students will go home and play on their computers, watch videos on youtube, or play video games. If a teacher can bring some of these technologies into the classroom their students will be more engaged in the learning process.\n",
      "  As a result of being a digital immigrant my students become the experts. Whereas some teachers might see this as a problem, I love that my students can correct or inform me. It levels the playing field and allows students to feel as though they are knowledgeable. I am happy to demonstrate to them that throughout life one is continually learning.\n",
      "  While Prensky offers many positives to incorporating technology into the classroom, I can see some difficulties. He explains that many teachers use excuses like they do not understand technology. As a digital immigrant, I do not agree that this is an excuse; I believe this is a reality. If schools want their teachers to use technology in the classroom they need to give them the tools. This can be accomplished through professional development sessions and a principal or vice principal who values the use of technology in the classroom.\n",
      "  Another issue of incorporating technology in the classroom is equity. Technology is expensive and many schools cannot afford to acquire it. Another issue of equity is students’ in a diverse classroom might have different accessibilities to technology. As a future educator I will be sensitive to this reality.\n",
      "  The last issue I have with the consistent use of technology in a classroom is the students’ potential to lose their rote skills. Technology usually does things automatically (i.e. spell check). Students might lose the understanding of the importance of spelling, calculating, looking up words in the dictionary, etc. All of these skills, although easily performed using technology, hold some value.\n",
      "  The use of technology has the ability to engage students in learning and teach them how to be successful in today’s society. As a digital immigrant I will strive to use technology in a cautious, thoughtful, and meaningful way, helping students to thrive. ,\n",
      "8,675,1,  When digital natives get to talking about how much “geek cred” they have (credibility as self proclaimed geeks), they usually start by listing the oldest and most rudimentary piece of technology they ever owned or worked on. My 10 year old self was the lucky recipient of an AST desktop computer with a 116MHz intel processor, 1.14 gb hard drive, 16 mb of RAM, and a 56k dialup modem. It was a hunk of junk compared to my smartphone, which would have seemed like alien technology if seen at the time.\n",
      "  I am a digital native, having surfed the internet before it was actually as useful as it is today. I was part of online forums, and was thus connected to people across the world. I have witnessed first-hand the evolution of technology, rejoicing every time a hurdle I had identified was overcome by engineering and efforts of the online community. Having been so immersed in this world, I can now point out digital immigrants, no matter how faint their “accent”.\n",
      "  I can identify with Prensky’s idea that digital natives process ideas differently from digital immigrants. I spend a lot of time translating back and forth when I want to explain my ideas, or when I want to understand the ideas of immigrants. Of note, I must add that these digital immigrants come in all ages and varieties. There are people that seem to be natives, but have really only mastered the Apple system. Furthermore, not all young people are natives. Being a native is a way of thinking. When one is a native, they tend to be able to understand how to interact with the technology, because they have adapted to the general way that the hardware and software engineers design their products. It is for this reason that my primary concern as a digital native is how to communicate with immigrants and bring them into my world.\n",
      "  One of the points I can identify with best in Prensky (2001) is that of digital immigrants thinking that technology will somehow not apply to a certain class or subject. We have reached the point at which technology can be integrated into anything. A digital native will go out of their way to integrate technology, even by jerry-rigging technology they have (if I saw a tutorial for a technology that I don’t have, I can replicate it with the technology I do have via some MacGyver style engineering).\n",
      "  My greatest concern now is that my students will somehow be more “native” than me. I started playing with tech when I was 10; now there are 2 year olds fiddling with iPads. I cannot help but wonder how different their brains will be in terms of recalling info (shorter?), scanning info for relevancy (faster?), and more. I believe it will take time for them to dictate the direction technology takes (grown ups make decisions), but I hope to be a flexible enough “immigrant” to adapt to them when the time comes.,\n",
      "8,678,1,Response to “Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants” by Marc Prensky\n",
      "              As I read the article “Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants”, I could not help but wonder whether I was a digital native or a digital immigrant.  Prensky identifies that the dissemination of digital media that occurred at the end of the 20th century has changed the fundamentals of how today’s students learn.  When I think back to my education, I don’t remember using much technology at all.  During elementary school, we rarely used computers; other than the few times that we went to the library to practice typing.  When I was in high school, I took a geography course that centered on the use of computers and GIS mapping software.  Apart from that and the odd PowerPoint presentation, I don’t remember much use of technology at all in my classrooms.  In my personal life, I had access to computers from a very young age, although for much of my childhood, it was not something that I used or needed every day.  I find that today, I generally feel comfortable using various technologies, but at a basic level when compared to their potential uses.  Hearing of the many technologies available to us as teachers, as well as witnessing the ease with which some students use various technologies, has made me realize that I do not identify as a digital native.  I cannot, however, say that I identify completely with Prensky’s description of a digital immigrant, and for this reason I would place myself somewhere in between the two.   I grew up with access to technology, and have a certain level of comfort with it, but it did not truly play a larger role in my life until my late teenage years and early adulthood.\n",
      "              As I progress through the MT program, I find that I increasingly believe that technology should play a large part in our classrooms.  At the beginning of the article, Prensky mentions that the way that students think and process information is fundamentally different than it was not too long ago, prior to the rapid introduction and development of new technology.  I think that this is something that today’s teachers need to be mindful of when planning their lessons.  However, I do recognize that integrating technology into the classroom can be a challenging endeavor.  While I have learned of the many technologies available to us, and I whole-heartedly agree with the importance of it’s use in the classroom, I do not feel confident that I will be able to incorporate technology into my classroom as much as I would like to.  I feel a little bit lost in this space between being a digital native and digital immigrant and that I am being pulled both ways.  I would love to incorporate technology into my classroom, but apart from workshops and in-class demonstrations, I have never seen a successful and large-scale implementation of technology in the classroom, which makes me wonder how I am going to be able to do it.\n",
      "              As teachers, we are constantly learning.  As we progress through our teaching careers, we will find ways to refine our practices.  Much of what we do as teachers, particularly when trying something new, is trial and error, and I believe that this applies to the use of technologies as well.  We must try new things and step outside of the comfort zone of the traditional teaching styles that many of us experienced as students.  I think that the first step is recognizing that it is important to adapt our teaching methods to our ever-changing society.  If we don’t, the disparity between a student’s experiences in their personal life, and their experiences in their schooling life will continue to grow.  It is important to close that gap and to provide a curriculum and classroom experience that is relevant.  Although I am not fully confident in my ability to use the various technologies available to us in the classroom, I do believe it to be an important aspect of teaching, and I am confident in saying that I am willing to try, and I am excited to learn.,\n",
      "8,679,1,Growing up in the nineties, I would consider myself on the border between a Digital Native and a Digital Immigrant. I believe that there is a wide range of both Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, but after reading Prensky’s article I would fall under the Digital Native Category. On one hand I am not the most technological savvy person, however I understand how to use the different forms of technology and I take advantage of these technologies using them on a daily basis.\n",
      "  The article reminded me of an incident that occurred during my first practicum. My associate teacher had typed up his hand written class notes, and had accidentally deleted them from his computer. During a lesson that day, he asked if I could retype them for him. I agreed to do so, it was mostly text with a couple of simple line-diagrams. In my opinion it wasn’t a very difficult task, however my associate teacher was very impressed by the fact that I was able to recreate the line-diagrams on the computer in a short period of time. He admitted that he was at a disadvantage for being less technologically inclined. He made the analogy stating that he was still making fire by rubbing sticks together, while I was using a lighter.\n",
      "  Once again, creating line-diagrams on a computer isn’t a technological phenomenon but even this simple skill can change a lesson plan. With a very intense curriculum timing is of great importance. Before I added the diagrams on to the computer, my AT would have to stop his lesson in order to draw them on the board. Whether or not teachers are Digital Natives or Digital immigrants, technology is a relevant and important aspect in teaching in the 21st century. Today students access some sort of technology on a daily basis. In many cases it is the first thing they do when they wake up, (smartphones, i-pads) and the last thing they do before they go to bed.\n",
      "  Being a Digital Native or a Digital Immigrant can definitely impact ones role as a teacher. During a technology in education workshop a quote was stated, ‘technology if used properly could make a lesson twice as effective, but if used incorrectly it could make it ten times worse.’ As Prensky argues we do not only have to teach Legacy content, but Future content in the language of our students who are Digital Natives.\n",
      "  It is evident that there are many different learning and teaching styles. As a future educator it is essential to be able to adapt your teaching style(s) to meet the learning style(s) of your students. In teaching in the 21st century, we must not only meet curriculum expectations but it is important on how we are teaching to these expectations. Prensky describes how it is more difficult in ‘learning new ways to do old stuff’. Furthermore, with advanced technology such as smart phones, information can be retrieved in matter of seconds. How does this influence ones pedagogy? For example, is there a point in memorizing specific dates in history? Technology can be used to enhance learning, but an overall goal across the curriculum is to promote and develop critical thinking. Fundamental education tools will always serve a purpose, but in my classroom, as a Digital Native I promote questions of how and why to become superior to what and when.  Our students are the future, we must act as vehicles in assisting our students in achieving their goals.    ,\n",

      "8,682,5,The problem with Prensky’s article is that it represents a fundamental conflict between content and communication.  Buried beneath the hyperbole, generalizations, and racist analogies are some important challenges to teachers that cannot go unconsidered or unanswered.  But by segregating the student and teacher population into two dichotomies that never meet, he has undermined his very argument – that the gap must be bridged – and renders his premise virtually useless.\n",
      "  I therefore reject Prensky’s Manichean separation between digital natives and immigrants. I myself am proof that a person can exhibit qualities of both camps.  My formative years occurred before the ascendancy of the internet, and I have a foot firmly with the digital immigrants.  I like to call my friends.  I look up words in a physical dictionary.  I take notes by hand.  I can go for days without being on the internet.\n",
      "  But educational and personal immersion in technology have turned me into a digital immigrant.  I can take notes on the computer, and relish the quick efficiency.  I also do all my writing and editing on the computer.  I can go for days just staring at the computer and running four programs simultaneously.  My skills in both areas have allowed me to survive and adapt in ways that others, used to only one toolbox, have not.  I lie outside the native-immigrant dichotomy, and I am not alone.  Prensky's premise is far too limiting to represent even a small slice of the population.\n",
      "  Instead, I prefer to align myself with White and Le Cornu’s system of categorization, that of digital residents vs. digital visitors (White and Le Cornu, 2011).  Prensky’s analogy wrongly draws a strict correlation between aptitude and age; White and Le Cornu’s binary, while equally limiting, at least provides the populace with a measure of free will and divides digital users according to the purpose to which they put technology.  Digital visitors see the digital landscape as a tool, and enter for specific purposes (i.e. communication, networking, research); digital residents see digital technology as an integral part of their life.\n",
      "  Based on my cumulative experiences, this categorization is more consistent with what I've observed.  I have not seen evidence that my students, or the younger generation, are thinking more quickly or more efficiently, which Prensky implies in describing their thinking as “faster [and] less step-by step [sic]” (p. 4).   However, I do see that a section of the population immerses themselves in a digital landscape in a way that I do not (the digital visitor).\n",
      "  As a teacher, it is my duty to allow students to access information however they can, to the best of their abilities, and without compromising their ability to adapt.  This is particularly important considering that we are preparing students for jobs that do not even exist.  To do this students must learn to be critical and open-minded; they must see that questions have multiple solutions, and that answers may be generated using multiple skills or tools.\n",

      "  Summary\n",
      "                 The School-to-Prison Pipeline, is the idea that schools are unable to meet all the needs of K-12 schooling. The 7th and final chapter explores the juvenile justice system and the rights that children should have when in this system. The creation of the juvenile justice system was designed to help children rather than to punish them for their crimes. However, the juvenile justice system not only is failing to help students reintegrating them into society, but treats children as criminals. Furthermore, children in the juvenile justice system will be arrested for softer crimes, not have the same rights when in the courts, and may end up in other institutions while waiting for trials (foster homes, detention facility).\n",
      "                 The second issue discussed in this chapter is about the approaches that can be taken to keep students out of prison. With the zero-tolerance policy, teachers are using the police more often to control unwarented behavior. This has resulted in more arrests among youth. It is suggested that legislation should be implemented to avoid children being incarcerated for soft crimes. Another suggestion made is for legislation to be created to protect students who have disabilities from being sent through the juvenile system. The last area that needs addressing is the racial disparity in the Juvenile system. Statistics have shown that there is an increase Black and Hispanic students being sent to prison while there is a reduction of White students being sent through the juvenile justice system.\n",
      "                 The most important thing that society can do to help children in the juvenile system is to provide education in these facilities. Without education, there is little chance that they will be properly treated. Unfortunately, education in the juvenile system is an area that needs great improvement as it is usually not given to children in the system. Furthermore, children that are put into adult prisons are even more likely to not become rehabilitated and educated. Lastly, children that have gone through the juvenile justice system have difficulty getting back into education.\n",
      "                 The chapter concludes with the hope that children who have gone through the juvenile system will be able to have an education and become treated\n",
      "    Discussion Questions\n",
      "1) An argument can be made that the continuing usage of police officers in schools is harming students rather than protecting them. Is there any value in having police officers in schools?\n",
      "  2) What can schools do (instead of going to the police) to help students with adolescent behaviour issues?\n",
      "  3) In the Juvenile Justice System, children do not have the same rights as an adult (i.e. children do not have the right to a jury trial). How do you think the juvenile justice system should change in order to ensure the equity of children detainees?\n",
      "  4) Most correctional facilities for youth do not provide a form of education even though children in the juvenile justice system have the right to have one. What can be done to ensure that all correctional facilities have an education system in place and enforced?\n",
      "  5) What can the system do to help children reintegrate into society and help get a proper education?\n",

      "  The findings implicate the Lauderdale County Youth Court, the Meridian Police Department (MPD) and the Mississippi Division of Youth Services (DYS) for perpetuating the systematic arrests. According to the DOJ, these entities have violated the constitutional due process rights of juveniles with their policy of arresting all suspended students, without regard to the type of offense. Students have been routinely placed in a juvenile prison for minor infractions such as dress code violations, flatulence, profanity and disrespect.\n",
      "  “The systematic disregard for children’s basic constitutional rights by agencies with a duty to protect and serve these children betrays the public trust,” Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “We hope to resolve the concerns outlined in our findings in a collaborative fashion, but we will not hesitate to take appropriate legal action if necessary.”\n",
      "  Looking at the demographics of Meridian, it becomes clear who this policy affects most. Sixty-two percent of the overall population is Black and 82 percent of school district’s children are Black.\n",
      "  The MPD's policy is to automatically arrests all students referred by the school district without any further inquiry. This broad oversight allows officers to skirt the procedure of obtaining prior youth court custody orders or make assessments of probable cause.\n",
      "  The DOJ has offered to negotiate with the parties, but if an agreement is not reached, Meridian will be forced to defend its policies in court.\n",

      "  Excerpt of article:\n",
      "  “The Safe Schools Act, in force from 2001 to 2008, took students out of school. It resulted in a \"zero tolerance\" approach to bad behaviour. In 2002-03, the number of students suspended in Ontario spiked to 157,436 – an increase of almost 50,000 from two years earlier. Almost one in five of those suspended was identified as having a learning disability or special need. The number expelled shot up to 1,786 from 106 in 2000-01.”\n",
      "The \"Roots of Youth Crime\" report to the provincial government last fall argued that zero tolerance \"increased the criminalization of marginalized youth.\" Critics argued it was targeting low-income and racial minority pupils, particularly blacks. Parents turned to the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which filed a discrimination complaint against the Ministry of Education and the Toronto board.\n",
      "The Liberal government responded with Bill 212. It gave school boards $44 million to set up alternative programs for suspended and expelled students and to hire 170 psychologists and social workers. Wynne describes the reform as an \"attempt to put a greater safety net around kids who are at risk.\"\n",
      "The bill pressured school boards to reduce suspensions and expulsions. Principals must consider whether mitigating circumstances, such as a learning disability, racism or bullying, led to unacceptable behaviour. (Suspensions are triggered automatically for having weapons, drugs or alcohol on school property, or for bullying.)\"\n",

      "She was telling me how problematic it is that, more often than not, black youth and Hispanic youth are brought through the criminal judicial system. It reminds me of the phrase that Wesley pointed out: \"You find crime where you police.\" (or something along those lines)\n",
      "My friend also mentioned how detrimental it can be for a young person to be convicted and sent to prison. In many of her experiences, she says that no \"correction\" occurs - that the time spent in prison actually does little to \"rehabilitate\" the individual and that it only perpetuates the problem. When prisoned youth are released, they find it increasingly difficult to obtain work and to reintegrate into school.\n",
      "She did however mention that on a positive note, she has seen a small shift in the judicial system when dealing with youth. Restorative justice practices and mentoring programs have become more common and I believe that these resolutions can lead to a positive outcome for troubled youths.\n",

      "Homeschooling 101\n",
      "It is estimated that roughly 1-2% of school aged children in North America are being homeschooled, which puts the number at 20,000 in Ontario alone.  Homeschooling their children away from formal institutions such as a public or private school is a right that parents are given.  However, this right is not available to parents all around the world.  While in Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand (which are fairly progressive when it comes to homeschooling policies and programming) homeschooling is completely legal, there are countries where it is completely illegal, under certain special exceptions, such as Sweden, Spain, and Greece.  Even more extreme is in Germany, where the practice it completely outlawed!\n",
      "    Motivation by parents in Canada stem mostly from achievement rather than avoidance.  A 2003 Pan-Canadian study on homeschooling in Canada, in which 1,648 English and French speaking families replied to a questionnaire, found that reasons for homeschooling were based on a combination of moral, social, familial, and academic goals.  Negative aspects based on avoidance of private/public education included issues on safety, being a big waste of time, and lack of discipline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parental Procedures and Resources\n",
      "    Legally speaking, the Education Act 21(1) requires that every child between the ages of six to sixteen to attend school, but in subsection 21(2), it lists legal reasons for that a child may be excused from attending school, one being if the child is receiving adequate instruction from home, or elsewhere.  Policy/Program Memorandum 131 provides parents and school boards with direction concerning policies relating to homeschooling.  First, a parent must notify the school board that they are with of their intent to homeschool their children in the sample letter provided below in Appendix B of PPM 131.  In it, parents are only required to give their child’s name, age, sex, mailing address, telephone number, and that they wish to homeschool their child(ren).  No list of lesson plans, curriculum they will be following, sample student work, etc. are required as a letter of intent is seen as grounds enough to assume a child will be receiving an adequate education.  This letter must be filled out every year before September 1st that the child is being homeschooled.\n",
      "    Within the PPM 131 guidelines, parents are made aware of the fact that they may have access to EQAO/OSSLT testing, as well as access to the Ministry of Education curriculum documents, but neither is necessary to use or take.  All universities in Ontario have a home school admittance policy (except for Queens University in Kingston), so it is not required for a homeschooled child to receive an Ontario Secondary School DIploma (OSSD).  Resources and support for homeschooling parents are available through the Ontario Federation of Teaching Parents (OFTP), Ontario Christian Home Educators Connection (OCHEC), and much more.  The community is strong, and growing every year!\n",
      "\n",
      "Procedures to be taken by the school/school board\n",
      "1) The child will be removed from attendance documentation, as the child is excused from attending school (subsection 21(2), clause (a) of the Ed. Act)\n",
      "2) Send to the home a letter confirming in writing the intent, names, ages and genders of the children being homeschooled, as well as giving parents information as to how they may access EQAO and OSLT testing.(See PPM 131 and Appendices B,C,D)\n",

      "  I felt challenged by this article, and the following interpretations, messy and partial, are themselves open to interpretation and challenge:\n",
      "  In \"White Is a Color!\", Roman addresses the discourse of 'white-defensesivenss', a position based on relativism that fails to acknowledge and address the systemic and material realities of disadvantage that can belie multicultural or pluralistic 'solutions' to inequality. We must, she says, move away from an essentialist view of race to focus on the \"unequal effects of racism\".  In other words, it's not enough to say, in Roman's opinion, to 'celebrate difference' in our classes. Whites claiming to suffer racism or that 'everyone suffers oppression' can \"bypass power as well as history to suggest a harmonious empty pluralism\". In other words,  muticultural, relativist and pluralistic discourses 'cover up' the fact that real inequality exists, and that whites are conferred upon a position of priviedge which they/we benefit from.\n",
      "  Roma brings feminism into the discussion and I don't fully understand her meaning here. I think that she's saying a similar thing happens within feminist discourses; by focusing on injustice that happens to 'us', we ignore/subsume voices of those who experience injustice beyond our personal experience (ie. non-white, poor, non-western women).\n",
      "  Those in positions of priviledge, Roman argues, label voices which call attention to inequality as  'extremist', and therefore demand the ignoring of these voices. She writes \"When educators assert or protect relativistic claims in the classroom, what emerges is an implicit endorsement, in not advocacy, of the existing social inequality\". It is not until we move to the \"hard work of coalition politics\" that we can begin to do the work of social justice and equity.\n",
      "  This all has major implications for educators, of course. In practical terms, Roman suggests that white students and teachers need to take a close look at their/our place of privilidge and their part in the narratives of racism. This is done through critical analysis of how their/our own racial interests function, and how \" the injustices they reap for others would necessarily become the objects of analyses of structural racism\".\n",
      "    Questions:\n",
      "  - As a teacher, would you bring issues of race into your classroom? If so, to what end? What challenges do you foresee in doing so?\n",
      "  - Would your positioning of issues of race or class differ if you were teaching predominately priviledged students versus predominately marginalized students? If so, how?\n",
      "  - Is empathy a concept that is relevant to Roman's argument? What does it mean to be empathetic regarding people's experience of disadvantage or discrimination?\n",
      "  - What does it mean to be an oppressor?\n",
      "  I know these are difficult questions; I hope they are valuable in some way. Looking forward to our discussion on Monday.\n",

      "  Summary\n",
      "Roman’s article challenges a prominent relativistic stance in anti-racist pedagogy in her time, and avers that much of the vocabulary, dialect, and dialogue around anti-racism is both reductionist and ultimately supportive of oppression.\n",
      "  First, it is important to situate Roman’s article historically.  Written and published between 1991-1993, she mentions at one point the “current national backlash against gains made [in] social justice” (p.73).  In the United States, this is a time of the 1987 stock market crash and the ensuing recession; George Bush and the Gulf War; the L.A. police beating of Rodney King  (a black man) and ensuing riots that killed 58 people; the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and several national controversies on corporal punishment in the justice system.  This was a time when the USA visibly warred between liberal social justice activism and neoliberal/conservative regressions.\n",
      "  In this context, it is important to ask how this affects her opinions.  Roman writes as a white, middle-class, Jewish, feminist, and the article is directed at those on a similar plateau of privilege.  She begins with a short discourse on the phrase “people of color”, deeming it a problematic term that actually subordinates those whom it attempts to empower, and that it ultimately relieves whites of the responsibility to challenge racism.  She then challenges the relativistic discourse around anti-racism – essentially that all sides have stories and all stories are equal, therefore we can all depart from the common ground of The Oppressed – and calls this (not in her words) a copout.  This is a privileged stance, Roman says, only afforded and used by those who use acknowledgement of privilege as a cover, and who, if they do not move from realization to acknowledgement to activism, further entrench race in a position of subordination.  There is complicity and ease in acknowledging complicity.\n",
      "  “Homeless people cannot eat discourse (p. 77): Talking cannot do anything without action, and self-realization and confession of inherent privileges does not change the racist, often unwittingly internalized status quo.  Roman, in fact, groups “diversity” and “multiculturalism” with “race” as vocabulary that tacitly subordinates the racialized groups, and states that race must be problematized as well as acknowledged.  She offers an alternative to the study of racism, a dialogue where those not considered “oppressed” (in whatever discriminatory setting) need to “speak with” rather than “speak for/instead”.  Innate to this new dialogue is a critical engagement of one’s place within discourse.\n",
      "  Questions\n",
      "“Whites are oppressed.”  Is this news to you?  Do we (and I do mean, we specifically, not we in general) actually unknowingly perpetuate the dominance of men/whites/heterosexuals in the language we use?  (Related question: You have a class of 4 whites, 5 black, and 1 Asian.  Who is in the minority?)\n",
      "Self-examination time!\n",
      "“What are the moral and political consequences of a teacher …. failing to challenge the epistemic standpoints of white students claiming to be oppressed on racial grounds?  Can teachers avoid the…impositions of our own critiques as master-narratives of authority upon what counts as the real in the service of radical social change?”\n",
      "Roman’s criticisms of relativism come very close to negating much of our learning at OISE.  We have been doing much reflection about relative sides of the story, and understanding different perspectives, but to Roman this is merely an example of, essentially, cowardly relativism and not of critical realism.  Are we taking the easy way out, at OISE, in schools, or in general?  Why or why not?\n",
      "“Homeless people cannot eat discourse.”  What is your reaction to this statement, and its implications? In that context, what do you think of Roman’s new paradigm, speaking with instead of speaking for/instead?\n",
      "We have discussed labels a lot in other classes – exceptionalities, races, cultures – and debated the usefulness of such labels.  Is “Jewish”, for instance, a race?  Ethnicity?  Nation?  Does it matter?  And ultimately, do these labels balkanize peoples, or do they serve a productive purpose in identification followed by unity?\n",
      "Think about some of the things we see and hear on the news: gender/age (cyber) bullying, Romney’s binders full of women, the election and possible re-election of Barack Obama, Omar Khadr, numerous Toronto shootings.  In this context, is Roman’s anti-relativism argument relevant?  Necessary?  Outdated? ,\n",

      "Summary:\n",
      "This is a complicated article to summarize, particularly in a short space. I am going to attempt to outline major themes and ideas. Please also read the summaries and questions posed by our peers; because they may have had a different perspective.\n",
      "  For Roman, “White is a Color” addresses a central contradiction within contemporary social studies. Similarly, the phrase, “people of colour” developed as a positive achievement of multiculturalism, and an alternative to more negative “racial” distinctions. However, Roman argues that it conveys the mistaken idea that racially subordinate groups are essential subjects of a single experience or system of racism.\n",
      "  Roman speaks from a postcolonial feminist perspective. Postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge to some of the organizing premises of Western Feminist thought. Feminist movements and theoretical developments were predominantly led by middle-class white women, and marginalized others. Postcolonial feminists, proposed alternative theoretical frameworks. Similarly, the multiculturalist ideology of difference as pluralism raises questions concerning what post colonial feminist critic Mohanty calls “a hastily derived notion of ‘universal sisterhood.’”\n",
      "  Roman contends that this tendency to treat race as a universal or concrete experience for all racially subordinate groups, contributes to white misrecognition of the effects of their own racially privileged locations. Roman argues that these stable categories must be challenged, by asking how race operates in a daily practice as a set of complex meanings, we move toward understanding how there are unequal effects of racism for different groups of people.\n",
      "  Roman also critiques the “politics of voice” or the crisis of “speaking for” others. Post modern skepticism as to whether anyone has or ought to have the authority to speak in the name of social change, to Roman is not altogether misguided. Roman proposes the provisional alternative of, “speaking with rather than for, the interests of oppressed groups who are engaged in critically evaluating and transforming existing social relations.” Although she is unable to define the politics of “speaking with” in any absolute way, she cites the relational politics of dialogue, between unequally located groups.\n",
      "  Questions:\n",
      "I would like to discuss some of the questions that Roman poses on page 81.\n",
      "Roman gives an example from her own experience and asks: How does she, a middle class, white, feminist teacher respond to or evaluate the claim made by a white, middle class student that she had been the subject of racial discrimination simply because she was outnumbered by the African American students in the class?\n",
      "*How broadly can the categories of difference and oppression be drawn and who gets to draw them?\n",
      "*Can teachers avoid the worst fears of postmodernists, that is imposing our own critiques as master narratives upon what counts in the service of radical and social change? (E.g. are we likely to speak FOR instead of WITH diverse racial groupings in which we do not belong?)\n",
      "  And if so, how do we bring issues of race into the classroom?\n",
      "  If we are teaching in a class that does not represent the diversity/multiculturalism of the society in which we live, and therefore can not engage in dialogue with students who have had different experiences, how do you speak “with”, instead of “for”?\n",
      "  How does our language/terminology make the assumption that subordinate races have the same experience? What other ways do we group and make assumptions about students based on their experiences? (Disadvantaged vrs. Advantaged students?)\n",
      "  Castenell, L. A., & Pinar, W. (New York). Understanding Curriculum as Racial Text: Representations of Identify and Difference in Education. 1993: SUNY Press.\n",
      "  Summary:\n",
      "Race is one of the categories that order our worlds. This book is dedicated to examining these categories as functions of the curriculum.\n",
      "“We speculate about their (categories) relationship to the world they name; we investigate the social processes that have constructed them and identify their presence in curriculum where they recapitulate and renew the common order.”\n",
      "  In my summary I use the term Blacks because that is the term Whatley uses.\n",
      "Chapter Four:\n",
      "Photographic Images of Blacks in Sexuality Texts\n",
      "Mariamne H. Whatley\n",
      "              Whatley examined sixteen college level texts, published from 1980-1987, to see how Blacks were presented in photographs. Photographs have more impact than a drawing because it is seen as an objective representation of reality. Whatley found a problematic pattern to the photos where Blacks appeared. She grouped these into the following recurrent themes: Blacks as “exotics,” Blacks as “sexually dangerous,” Blacks as asexual, and Blacks and paternal responsibility. She feels it is essential to examine the curricular materials, since textbook publishers define their market as the teacher or the professor, not the student. Therefore there is some potential for faculty to exert economic, as well as critical pressure to promote change. Whatley argues there have been significant gains in the surface messages presented on gender and race issues, however covert messages in many forms contradict this intent. Whatley argues, with her theoretical background, that photographs in texts are chosen, composed, constructed, objective and don’t reflect reality. Researcher Barthes argues that the captions also become as “real” and “objective” as the photograph itself is believed to be. Photographs can carry messages, intentional or not, never stated in the text. In examining texts the power of photographs should never be underestimated.\n",
      "            There is a great diversity of whites in sexuality texts therefore they may be seen as individuals or a part of a particular subgroup, such as teenagers or transsexuals, rather than representative of the entire white population. However, since so few images of cultural and racial minorities appear, each representation bears more weight.  Unless one consciously works against this, the representations of nondominant groups in the media can be used as a way to perpetuate the myth of inferiority, reinforce stereotypes and maintain the status quo.  She argues that textbook authors and editors tend to be “liberal” in their representations of race and culture. The difficulty may come in identifying subtle ways in which the most well intended text becomes subverted by the images presented.\n",
      "Examples from the text:\n",
      "Blacks as exotic: pictures from around the world highlighting difference. E.g. Trobraind Island girls from New Guinea sing bawdy songs and dance to attract boys. Is this really that different from a North American bar scene or high school dance?\n",
      "  Blacks as sexually dangerous: E.g. In all four cases that pimps were featured they were black.\n",
      "  Blacks as asexual and Blacks and paternal responsibility: Presentation may be a conscious attempt to counter myths.\n",
      "  Questions:\n",
      "Educational texts are a multi-million dollar industry. How much change could we promote by choosing not to use certain texts for political reasons?\n",
      "How will you choose your curricular materials/text?\n",
      "How much freedom do you think you will have?\n",
      "Whatley says textbooks are not objective and factual but instead are social products, if we accept this, how do we foster critical thinking in our students around these texts?\n",

      "Patricia Hill Collins\n",
      "Despite a resistant political climate, African American studies has established itself as an academic discipline. Prior to the 1960s, African American studies existed as an area of inquiry, but it only achieved the status of a discipline when black scholars started gaining positions of power within academic institutions and were able to certify knowledge. Yet this situation presents a challenge to the discipline.\n",
      "The need to protect itself as a discipline within predominantly white institution has forced black scholars to adopt notions of unity and uniformity at the expense of diversity and rich dialogue. The diversity in the African American experience is therefore not properly represented in the academic discipline for the sake of maintaining the academic standards that give the discipline its legitimacy. The discipline faces the challenge of attracting the visionary minds who will challenge and transform those standards or it risks being destroyed from within.\n",
      "\n",
      "Race and class are the major competing theoretical lenses that frame the discourse within the discipline. The author argues that rather than competition, scholars should realize that neither lens is complete enough to explain all aspects of the black experience, and that the discipline would benefit from the addition of gender as a third paradigm within the discipline. We must recognize that black intellectual women’s thought has been silenced by the dominant male perspective of what constitutes intellectualism. Black feminist scholars have faced pressure to apply race as main paradigm of their studies. For example, during the 1970s and 1980s they have often found it easier to examine racism within predominantly white feminist organization than to examine sexism within black organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author concludes that the future of African American studies depends on its ability to break the silence on gender issues; recognize that gender, race, and class are not mutually exclusive paradigms; and maintain an inclusive intellectual community that will attract and retain women.\n",

      "White Is Colour!\n",

      "White is also a colour! Institutionalized whiteness puts whites in a position of power  Current notions of multiculturalism are fake. We are asked to celebrate diversity without acknowledging white privilege, implying that whites are free from the responsibility to challenge racism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relativism means acknowledging all knowledge as equally valid, and therefore teachers who endorse relativistic claims indirectly endorse existing social inequities. Educators need to reframe curriculum as a dialogue and democratize knowledge and construction of theory. We cannot separate the knowledge from the interest group that it represents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through such critical lens white students could learn to recognize that racism is not only an individual expression of prejudice, but it also exists at a deeper systemic level that privileges the white.\n",

Is this a real shift towards challenging existing power structures or just another example of relativism?\n",

I highly recommend looking over other group summaries in order to fully grasp major themes in this week’s readings, as we will not be able to cover all issues in our short discussion:\n",
      "  Summary\n",
      "              The concept of ‘race’ inadvertently (or perhaps not, by groups of privilege) acts to further differentiate between the ‘self’ and ‘other’.  However, the idea of race, which defines who the “people of colour”, “other”, or “racially subordinate” are, changes in different political times and points in history.  Issues of who is considered “white” also change with time.  “Whites” become “those who are the privileged or dominant ones”.  Identity is also constantly changing, because it too is a construct of history, gender, and race.\n",
      "            Humans create curriculum, as a discursive formation of identity and difference, which in effect becomes reality, or human reality.  Curriculum is in affect a representation of how we wish to identify ourselves to our children.  In other words, what we teach our children in school determines what we think we are, and what they might one day become.  It outlines what it means to be “American” or “Canadian”, or of a certain gender, or race.  Therefore, if through curriculum we identify ourselves, it directly becomes a racial text, a political text, a gender text, etc.\n",
      "            There is a saying that goes “we are what we know”, but is it not also true that “we are what we do not know”?  If what we know about ourselves culturally, historically, and nationally is skewed by “absences, incompleteness, and denials”, then our identity is also fractured.  So, a curriculum with a Eurocentric view, for example, does not only deny non-Europeans knowledge about themselves, but it also denies “whites” self-understanding.  The “American” or “Canadian” self becomes repressed because the whole story is not being told.  The ‘people’ who built the country should be acknowledged for their hard work, and be part of it’s identity as self.  Institutional racism comes in through curriculum when it does not represent the lived experiences of non-European students.\n",
      "            Because curriculum is a racial text, issues of racism must be brought up in the classroom.  In order to not dig the “racially subordinate” deeper into sub ordinance, it must be known to students that the idea of ‘race’ privileges “whites”, and that celebrating multicultural backgrounds within the classroom is not enough.  There is innate inequality that exists because not everyone is oppressed in the same way, especially not “whites”.\n",
      "    Facilitation Questions\n",
      "  1) How do you intend to tackle issues of racism in your class, whether marginalized students are there, or not?  Would you even know how to, or want to, conduct such critical analysis of the deeper systemic issues of racism?\n",
      "  2) By 2050, it is projected that minority groups will become the majority, at least in the United States, as outlined in the readings.  What affect, if any, may this have on national identity and specifically on the idea of “white” and “other”?\n",
      "  3) How does the Ontario Curriculum identify who we are as Canadians, nationally and racially, to our children?\n",
      "  4) Because curriculum is a racial text, and will always be one, are we, as Canadians, presenting a story that is representative of our true identity, even though it may not be as European as we may think?  Is the fact that curriculum is a racial text, or political text etc. necessarily a bad thing?,\n",

      "By: Leslie G. Roman\n",
      "  Summary:\n",
      "  Roman offers an interesting perspective on the philosophical underpinnings of feminist interpretations of whiteness and racism. She argues that, the idea of harmonious diversity is euphemistic, claiming, as Linda Alcoff also argues, that speaking or advocating on behalf of the \"voiceless\" or oppressed is essentially a reiteration of privilege. Indeed, advocating for the \"other\" is further silencing those that are spoken for. Moreover, Roman provides an overview of feminist advocacy, and then posits a progressive, materialist and anti-racist pedagogy. She argues that the classroom needs to act as an oppourtunity for those who are oppressed to engage in dialogical discourse with those who are situated within privilege. This discourse removes a teacher-enforced master narrative and allows for a mutually constructed and socially contested realism to exist. In effect, This dialogue will democratize production of theory, or more simply, allow race theory to be critiqued through those living within the experience of the classroom or institutionalized privilege. Further, Roman proposed that this method of dialogue will move the conversation from \"white-defensiveness\" to \"appropriate speech where we/they take effective responsibility and action for disinvestigating racial privilege\".\n",
      "  Questions:\n",
      "  1. Within the context of last weeks discussion, as raised by Tanya's point, where we discussed a desire to move beyond difference to a kind of reality where \"non-racism\" exists  - do you think that Roman's propsed pedogogy is enough? Does it problematize inclusivity because it undermines the idea of multicultural or diverse harmony?\n",
      "  2. Does Roman's \"theoretical plan\" seem plausible in a middle school context OR What challenges might by met by developing this kind of dialogic discourse?\n",
      "  3. At Voice School, I was struck by how deeply students engaged with the content I provided, but realized that there is an inherent vulnerability to the act of sharing oppression - how can we develop a method to ensure students feel safe within a highly emotionally charged classroom context?\n",
      "    Canonical Sins\n",
      "By: Peter M. Taubman\n",
      "  Summary:\n",
      "  Taubman uses a psychoanalytic perspective on literature, as well as the concept of the literary canon to depict the binary of \"sameness\", as explained by the canon, and \"otherness, as shown through the oppositional discourse. He argues that both groups, ultimately, employ the same strategies to defend and destroy (or shift) the status quo. Taubman articulates that neither disrupt the system in a meaninful way, and simply reappropriate the idols and privilege different texts. He posits that within classrooms we need to allow students to develop their own meaning from within the texts, rather than furthering master narratives.\n",
      "  Questions:\n",
      "  1. Is the curriculum, essentially, a master-narrative?\n",
      "  2. Do the students require different tools of discourse to engage meaningfully with texts?\n",
      "  3. Does this notion of canonical texts reinforce or alter your perception of literature you appreciate? OR Do you think it will affect the way you look at your literacy program?,\n",

      "8,818,1,  It was an interesting time to observe technology related policies at my placement school this term because there have been some significant changes and new initiatives within the PDSB. Despite the new developments, the policies regarding technology use haven’t really changed much so let’s look at those first. The board provides five guiding principles for appropriate technology use:\n",
      "1.       Technology should support teaching and learning, and enable efficient administration and communication throughout the board.\n",
      "2.       Reasonable precautions should be taken to ensure the data being used is kept safe and secure.\n",
      "3.       Resources are limited and should not be used wastefully.\n",
      "4.       Technology users should operate within federal and provincial laws, as well as board policies and procedures.\n",
      "5.       Any data stored on board technology is owned and may be accessed by the board. There should be no expectation of privacy.\n",
      "  The school itself had it’s own policies which seemed to abide by the above guidelines:\n",
      "1.       No improper/unethical use of technology (computer hacking, cyber-bullying).\n",
      "2.       Cell Phones may not be used for any communication or for taking photographs unless granted permission by a school official.\n",
      "3.       No posting photographs or images on the Internet without adult permission.\n",
      "  Now let’s look at the changes and initiatives. The board recognizes that students want to take technology they use on a day-to-day basis and integrate it with how they learn at school. So in an effort to accommodate the needs of their students and promote the 21st Century Skills, the PDSB has implemented a new initiative called the LITP (Learning and Instructional Technology Plan – see links below) as of March 27, 2012. In a nutshell, this plan, which includes the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy, seeks to install WiFi in every school (by the end of the 2012 – 2013 school year) in Peel and encourage students to bring their wireless devices (laptops, tablets, smart phones, iPods, and more) to class (but remember, using these technologies in the classroom must still follow the 5 guidelines since they’re accessing board owned internet services). Moreover, in the spirit of equitable technology access, more wireless devices will be purchased by each school to be available for their students.\n",
      "  So why use wireless technologies? Wireless technology has been shown to improve research skills, student engagement and achievement. It also allows for teachers to be more creative and innovative with instruction, build on social responsibility and digital literacy, and even strengthen their connection with parents.\n",
      "  I saw a lot of cell phones and iPods in my classroom because of the BYOD policy. It was great for the most part. Students used them effectively, and were able to take better quality notes than if forced to use paper and pen/pencil. There were a few problems though. Having a cell phone in class can be very distracting for a middle school student, especially one with ADHD, and actually diminish engagement with curricular content. As a result, student achievement would drop. It goes without saying that a teacher can’t monitor their students at all times. So students will text in class and take part in cyber-bullying in real time. This was an ongoing problem with one of my students.\n",
      "  There are other problems exist at the board level. Not every school is able to get WiFi right away, and the main reason for this is actually funding, not installation time like the board states in their LITP document (see link below). I know this from personally speaking to some of the IT workers who came to my placement school to install the WiFi network there. They can get every school in Peel within a year but that wouldn’t happen because the board doesn’t have enough money to do so. Moreover, once the WiFi is installed, the coverage isn’t that great. The network cannot be accessed from all parts of the school, and thus it’s possible for multiple classes to be excluded from access to the WiFi network (as was the case in my practicum school!).\n",

      "8,824,3,    My placement this term took place in Fossil Hill Public School in the York Region District School Board. During my placement, I noticed technology being used throughout the school and I noticed that students were permitted more freedom with their technology than in my first placement, which also took place in a York Region Public School.\n",
      "            The Board Policy #194.0 entitled “Appropriate Use of Technology”  states that the school board “understands the benefits that technology can bring to support its daily operating activities and student achievements.”  According to the policy, students are able to use technology, including social networking sites, as well as bring cell phones to school, as long as they are being used for curriculum purposes and are under supervision of the teacher.\n",
      "            I believe that the Board policy on technology supports student learning. It indicates that teachers are responsible for “instructing and modeling for students the appropriate use of technology.” This is an important guideline for student learning. Instead of banning technology because of possible misuse, it asks the teachers to model appropriate use, which is beneficial for students, especially in the 21st century. The Board policy also indicates that teacher cell phone use in classrooms is for instructional purposes only. This statement suggests that teachers are allowed to bring cell phones to class. I think this is beneficial for student learning as well. There were a few times in my placement where I was able to take out my cell phone for instructional use, which aided the students. If the board banned cell phones altogether, there would have been a loss of many teachable moments.\n",
      "            The York Region District School Board also sends out “Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement” forms for primary, junior, transition, and senior students. This form indicates that modern, responsive learning environments integrate technology seamlessly into all aspects of learning. Again, YRDSB acknowledges that technology enhances student learning. The form, however, suggests that the students must adhere to the school’s Code of Conduct, which may differ in opinion.\n",
      "            The Fossil Hill school website indicates that the school policy on technology can be located in the agenda. The agenda states that computers and Internet can be used, but for curriculum purposes only. Unlike the board policy, which tells teachers that they can use social networking sites for curriculum purposes, the school policy states that social networking sites are not permitted.  I am unsure, however, if this is always the case, or if this is just a rule for the children and there is an exception if the teacher requires them to access social networking sites for class.  If there is no exception to this rule, then this may impede student learning as social networking sites can be engaging and educational if used in the correct way.\n",
      "            My classroom teacher did not have strict guidelines on technology. There were no forms that were sent home indicating the rules for cell phones or Internet use in class. The relaxed attitude towards technology aided the use of student learning in this case, as the students were responsible enough to handle technology appropriately. If technology constantly became a distraction, then the relaxed attitudes may have been harmful and stricter measures would have to be put in place.\n",

      "  I observed many interactions and usages of technology on the classroom level, the school level and the board level. With regard to cell phone use, the school exhibits a strict no cell phone policy. Cell phones, if brought to school, are to remain in lockers, and can only be used by middle school students if and when they go off campus at lunch for safety purposes. Aside from the obvious interference that cell phones would have in the class, I think there is the obvious underlying intention of remaining equitable among all students, given the diverse economic backgrounds that make up the Moraine Hills student population.\n",
      "  Majority of classrooms are equipped with a SmartBoard, the benefits of which are inarguably plentiful. The SmartBoard bridges the gap between the technology that students today yearn for and the need for direct, effective teaching and learning.\n",
      "  Most J/I teachers set up a class website, called a Moodle, to which students and parents can access anywhere, anytime. All homework, assignments and general information is reported on the Moodle, so that everyone is on the same page at all times. The Moodle serves as an excellent, comprehensive, user-friendly communication tool between teacher and student, student and parent, and teacher and parent. Since teachers can monitor Moodle usage, it also serves as an assessment tool to gauge how often students are utilizing the information that is being given to them online in order to help them and better their learning process. If well maintained, the Moodle can prove to be an excellent teaching tool to strengthen student learning and to alleviate any miscommunications between teachers, students and parents.\n",

      "  On the school website parents can sign up for regular school updates to be delivered electronically to them. Given the current situation with Teacher Labour Relations, this served as an effective tool to get information home and to maintain ongoing contact and communication with parents both quickly and efficiently.\n",
      "  In the newsletter there is a section on Internet safely, outlining how students can be aware of unsolicited online messages or websites, and how to surf the net safely. This shows that the school is doing its part to make parents and students aware of the implications that come along with a connection to the Internet. The newsletter also provides information and a link to students and parents for online extra help and support for grade 7 and 8 students struggling in math. The benefit of this online resource is that often (given the demographics of the school) many students’ parents are not fluent enough in English to offer them assistance with schoolwork.\n",

This policy outlines the responsibilities on part of the students, the teachers, the principals, the superintendents, the managers and all general users including ITS (information technology services) with regards to appropriate, safe and educational use of technology.

Althouse student leaves cell phones, pagers, and other electronic equipment at home, because the school takes no responsibility if these items are lost or stolen”.  I will get back to this point later.\n",
      "            All other technology queries can be attained from the TDSB’s “Code of Online Conduct”, which applies to students and employees using the board’s online systems and resources.  Students and employees (including teachers of course) sign a contract at the beginning of the year pertaining to this code of conduct.  In it, users are made aware of personal safety rules, unacceptable sites and materials, use guidelines, prohibited uses and activities, consequences, online publishing, and liability.\n",
      "            A code of conduct this specific is necessary, especially when students are not allowed to bring personal devices to school, as well as using technology publicly funded by the TDSB.  This code has been constantly updated to suit the needs of the time, and cyber bullying seems to be a huge issue now more than ever.  The principal at John G. Althouse actually gave a talk on the first day of school regarding this.  The board code of online conduct echoes what she mentioned: never reveal personal information about yourself or someone else to strangers or in cases where this information can be used for harmful purposes, never use the system to threaten, intimidate, or discriminate against other people, never use inappropriate/abusive language or conduct, or violate the rights of any other person.\n",
      "            Such a code, however, does not pertain to private/home systems and networks.  This is where the school’s code of conduct helps.  Students are expected to be respectful to one another, and to “treat others as they would want to be treated”.  These points may refer to issues regarding all aspects of life, including life online.\n",
      "            There is no question that the board code of online conduct will only better student learning, but I am not sure if disallowing students to bring electronic devices to school necessarily will.   At first glance, it seems like this is a way for the school to avoid the issue altogether.  “If we do not allow personal devices to school, we will not have any issues with it”.  I think that as long as the students have adequate access to technology at school, not allowing students to bring electronic devices may be a viable option.  Personal devices may be a distraction after all.  In schools where access to technology may be limited, using every resource available to support learning, even devices students have at their own personal disposal, may be the best option in that instance.  This, however, was not the case at my practicum school, which had all the new gadgets we have been talking about in our tech class.  So, perhaps such an overarching rule is not all that bad here after all.\n",

      "8,833,2,  For this term I was placed at John Wanless (J.W) Public School in the Toronto District School Board. J.W. is a K-6 school located in an affluent area of the city. J.W students have access to various technologies both at home and at school. Each classroom is equipped with a SmartBoard and the schools set of 30 netbooks and 20 iPads are available to teachers on a sign-out basis. The library contains 20 desktops that students can use during their library period (once a week) or by special request.\n",
      "  Throughout my placement, discussion pertaining to the schools technology policies occurred once, when a student’s cell phone began ringing during a lesson. My AT asked the student to turn off the phone, and reminded the class about the rules pertaining to cell phone use. In the student agenda, a section titled, Cell Phones and Electronic Devices states “ all personal communication devices are to be powered off and stored out of view during instructional class” (p.13). Students at J.W, and in particular in my grade six class, abided by the technology policies. The above student’s embarrassed reaction along with the class’ response led me to believe that an incident like this is rare at J.W. I believe technologies can enhance student learning but if the above example was commonplace in a classroom, interruptions or distractions provoked by technologies could in fact impede student learning. Policies are definitely needed to monitor the use of technologies at school.\n",
      "  Apart from student agendas, the only other mention of technology policies at J.W occurs at the beginning of the year when the TDSB’s Code of Online-Conduct form, is sent home for students and parents to read and sign. According to the form, TDSB understands that the “Internet is a rich source of information and [has] opportunities to enhance student learning. However, increased access to the Internet raises issues that must be addressed and understood ” (p.6).  Parents and students must sign the agreement, which states they have read the rules and understand that if a student breaks the rules “their computer access privileges may be suspended and that further disciplinary or appropriate legal action may be taken” (p.6). Apart from the two mentioned sources, technology related polices were neither visible nor mentioned in newsletters, school website, or elsewhere.\n",
      "  I tried to incorporate technologies such as the SmartBoard, computers, and iPads in my lessons as best I could. I felt that students were able to bring their “digital native” skills to the subject content, which in turn increased their interest and helped consolidate their learning. Technology helped support learning as it allowed for students to demonstrate their knowledge in creative and diverse ways.  Students enhanced their research skills, and used multimedia presentations to supplement oral presentations and for some this increased their confidence as well. Incorporating technology in teaching at J.W is not strenuous nor time-consuming because polices are in place, and students abide by the rules.\n",

      "8,836,1,  Policies for technology use by students and teachers are important for successful integration of technology in the classroom. The York Region District School Board (YRDSB) has many policies in place to ensure that all schools, principals and teachers that are “on board” in terms of the benefits of technology use in the classroom, have access to the tools that they need to implement technology use. For example, the YRDSB emphasizes the need for reliable hardware, and access to support services in the case of technical difficulties (Board, 2004), a value which I witnessed being upheld during my practicum.\n",
      "Rogers P.S. itself promotes the use of technology. While the school website has no explicit school policy regarding the importance of technology use in the classroom, the school speaks for itself. (York Region District School Board, 2012) Rogers P.S. is equipped with one “computer pod” that consists of 8 computers, two laptop carts equipped with 25 computers and 25 computers in the library. The classrooms share smartboards and projectors, among other types of technology, making it easy for teachers to integrate technology into student learning.\n",
      "Access to technology was obviously not an issue at Rogers, however responsible use was a problem that I encountered at this school and at previous practica. Rogers P.S. provided internet access to all devices through a Wifi network which made it very convenient for educators to integrate the internet into lessons and learning. Unfortunately, this access was also granted to students who took advantage of this freedom by accessing off-topic online content during class time. I witnessed numerous occasions of students playing online games, chatting and e-mailing on personal laptops during class time. Internet misuse during school hours is completely unacceptable, and according to a “technology user agreement” for Junior students, the board agrees with this. (York Region District School Board) This agreement – available on the school website - is a form to be signed by students and their parents, acknowledging that they agree to use their technology devices during school hours for educational purposes, and to maintain respect for the board and their school through their technology use.\n",
      "I believe that the policies of the board - to allow, encourage and provide technology to students to improve student learning - help students learn to their best ability. I have seen cases of students who were able to grasp difficult concepts and students who were rendered more able to communicate through the use of technology. In this way, board policies supported students learning. Unfortunately, technology was also a distraction to students because of a failure to emphasize the importance of appropriate technology use during school hours. The future of the classroom will see more and more students bringing ministry-provided laptops and personal-use laptops into the class. Access, support and regulation for appropriate laptop use are important and need to be made a priority by the board for technology integration to work. However, once the technology is provided, the responsibility lies with teachers and principals to make appropriate use a reality. I look forward to continuing to get a broader sense in the future of what strategies and techniques teachers use to address this problem.\n",

      "8,837,1,  During my practicum at Fossil Hill public school in York Region, I observed a lot of technology being used by staff and students. I was aware of YRDSB Policy 194.0 - Appropriate use of Technology. I am pleased that the first sentence of this policy explains that the board recognizes the benefits of using technology to support student learning. It was evident that the use technology use was encouraged by the amount available in the school. My class shared a pod with 3 other classes. In this pod, there was a laptop cart with 25 netbooks, 3 projectors, 2 document cameras and 1 smart board. There were also around 20 desktop computers in the pod. I was fortunate to take advantage of this technology while teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policy then outlines teacher responsibility, “the overall management of student use of computing and information technology facilities and resources within their assigned teaching areas or when acting in a supervisory role; and instructing and modeling for students the appropriate use of technology.” The teacher has a huge responsibility to supervise and model technology use. During my practicum, students in my class used netbooks to create Bitstrip comics and to access the Internet for research. I noticed my teacher model how to use bitstrips and tell students specific websites to use for research.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Further, I set up an Edmodo group for my class. I modeled how to create an account and what kinds of messages students should post. We had a discussion about appropriate use of language on Edmodo and the students were very receptive. I used Edmodo to post daily homework, generate discussions about classroom concepts and communicate with students to clarify assignments. I found this tool effective as students were engaged in learning while at home. I often posted games related to science and math homework for students to play at home, which they enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The board policy states, “if using social networking tools, do so with the appropriate understandings of the effective educational use of these tools, avoiding any personal uses when engaging with students, parents and colleagues for professional purposes.”  I feel that I followed this policy as Edmodo was used for classroom discussion and learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the Board Policy 194.0, the 2012-2013 parent and student guide to the school year includes an Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement. “All students and their parents/guardians must sign a form to acknowledge they have read, understand and will support the requirements/ conditions/rules concerning the use of school/Board and personal technology as it supports learning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the items students are accountable when signing this policy include: following the Board’s Safe, Caring and Supportive Schools Policy and the school Code of Conduct, using technology responsibly for educational purposes as assigned by a teacher and treating all school technology with respect. I saw this upheld at Fossil Hill. However, I was surprised that as part of the agreement, it states students are accountable for keeping personal information private (e.g. not publishing photos, names, â€¨addresses or phone numbers on the Internet). It seems like it is against this York Region policy for students to have Facebook or be part of other social networking sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the policy states that consequences for not following the rules range from withdrawal of privileges to suspension, I do not think this particular rule about personal information is enforced. A question I asked myself while learning about these policies is should a school board have control over what students do on the Internet outside of school?\n",

      "  The lesson plan itself is long, because it should build on previous learnings of self-expression through art and things like line, shape, form and balance. Also, I found that students take at least two 45 minute periods to finish a painting. ,\n",
      "8,839,1,                  This practicum, I had the opportunity to run several of my own projects, two of which were internet intensive. In the first, I had gifted grade 6 students research a country for the social studies trading partners component. In the second, I had grade 6/7 gifted students analyze different types of online media (and their associated revenue collection streams) and then create their own informative/persuasive websites. The projects were successful and safe overall, a fact I attribute primarily to my technical know-how.\n",
      "                I had the opportunity to observe this same class in the first week of September. During this time, there was the inevitable logistical nightmare of completing paperwork – including the signing of a form explaining that the parents had read the “Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement” and “Safe, Caring, and Supportive Schools Policy”. In the case of junior and intermediate grades, the students had to sign the agreement as well. The latter document is the same for all students and essentially targets bullying behaviour and the associated flowchart of discipline.\n",
      "The former document is more interesting. There is a different form for each range of grades, and they are linked here: Primary, Junior, and Senior. Each progressively gives more freedom to students. The primary has a series of “promises” that the students will only do what the teacher asks of them. The other two agreements give students more leeway, as it is understood that they will be doing research which requires the freedom to explore many different sources. The most important points on the junior form, as they relate to safety, are not sharing one’s personal information and respecting others’ needs for privacy. This is certainly important, but if the purpose of this whole process is to avoid having security leaks and preventing damage to school technology (software and hardware) then it is severely lacking.\n",
      "Before beginning my two units, I set up a data projector and had students analyze what makes a good Google search result, and what makes a bad/suspicious one, as a class. I did the same for judging a website’s authenticity. Many of the students were not aware of these facts, which are necessary for developing an internet legitimacy “gut instinct”. I developed my own gut instinct via trial and error after years of internet surfing. It also helped that I was aware of the reasons that some sites should not be visited and some programs should not be downloaded: profit via some sneaky means of advertisement or hacking, or straight up maliciousness. I have fixed many computers, and whenever it has been a software problem, it has been due to indiscriminate internet-surfing habits.\n",
      "My theory is that students are not led to develop these instincts because the people teaching them do not possess them. Many people have not bothered to learn these things because they did not grow up with them. Thus, it would require that they invest significant time and efforts to understanding how things function online. Since this process will not occur on its own, teachers must be educated in this subject both in terms of actual subject content and on the importance of having this knowledge; it is only then that a significant portion of this next generation of connected citizens will be able to use their connectivity systems safely.\n",

      "8,841,1,The TCDSB school at which I completed my most recent placement seemed to be in a transition in terms of its interpretation and implementation of the board policies around technology use in schools.  Though, according to TCDSB policy, the school has access to classroom technology and the backing of board policy to integrate technology in daily activities, I would say that it generally fails to do so.\n",
      "  Though it had a principal who seemed very much in favor of realizing the board’s goals around what they call 21st century learning, little seemed to be happening in classrooms that would indicate those goals were being actively pursued. The reason for this, as far as I could tell, was that it is ultimately up to teachers to decide how technology would or would not be a part of classroom ife. In the case of this school, most teachers decided not to use technology.\n",
      "  The teaching staff was somewhat polarized on the issue of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy which came into effect as of September 2012. The school’s principal, young and formerly an IT worker, valued technology and wanted it to play a significant role in the school's classrooms. She faced resistance from (generally speaking) the more senior members of her teaching staff, who rolled their eyes at the policy and the school’s 2012 PD theme of ‘21st century learning.

      "8,842,1,  My practicum took place in an elementary (K-5) school in the TDSB, and as such is governed by the TDSB’s Code of Online Conduct (linked below).  The Code is a guide outlining permissible and unacceptable behaviour while online on school grounds, and details the importance of guarding personal while accessing unsafe websites and posting information (personal or otherwise) on the internet.   However, the Code of Online Conduct is equally a legal document protecting the TDSB, not only specifying that the express educational tethering to the TDSB, but also exempting them from\n",
      "  “warranties of any nature or kind, expressed or implied, regarding its online services or resources, the continued operation of these services, the equipment and facilities used and their capacities, or the suitability, operability and safety of any program or file posted on TDSB systems for any intended purpose.”\n",
      "  This last has the particular effect of leaving technology usage across the city extremely diverse; at my practicum, it was present but largely inaccessible.  As such, technology was often an afterthought in both student and teacher use.  Student agendas included the TDSB’s code of online conduct but neither they nor parents were required to sign a code of online or technological conduct.  Technology was not a large part of the school’s culture – a scan of posters around the school revealed concerns for the environment, homophobia, racism, and bullying.  Only in the latter does technology appear as the occasional sidebar regarding cyber bullying; student learning around cyber bullying depended entirely on the teacher.\n",
      "  Student access to computers was realistically limited to weekly appearances in the library, which doubled as the computer lab, and where students were expected by October to have both their student number and password memorized.  Sharing of usernames and passwords was strictly forbidden, so those students who regularly forgot their login information (or who forget their agendas, where it is written down) shared computers with another student if the work was only research related.\n",

      "8,843,1,  My placement this term took place at Cosburn Middle School in the Toronto District School Board. Despite a commitment to expanding technology infrastructure and use in the board, my initial observation in my placements, which have all been with the TDSB, is that technology integration is not prioritized, particularly in comparison with other Ontario Boards. For example, unlike in the PDSB and the YRDSB cell phones or personal devices have not been permitted in any of my placement schools. At Cosburn cell phones were strictly prohibited for both teachers and students during class time. If you wanted to allow students to use their cell phones in class for educational purposes you needed to have your lesson approved by the principal beforehand. Teachers were also reminded at both staff meetings that I attended that personal cell phone use should never occur during school hours.\n",
      "            The TDSB is committed to increasing student access to technology and increasing the use of assistive technologies. The board believes that new technologies have the power to stimulate the development of intellectual skills, provide new and diverse educational opportunities, and prepare students for how they’ll use technology in their future careers. The TDSB Classroom Technology Migration Initiative (CTMI) establishes the framework for a supportable, advanced and secured on-line learning environment, with the overall goal of supporting student learning.\n",
      "            Despite these advancements the TDSB’s vision for 2015: all TDSB sites wireless enabled, every classroom and every teacher will have access to a computer, every student will have access to an electronic learning environment and parents will have electronic access to teachers and information about their child and the school environment, seems conservative. The TDSB’s approach to technology is governed by the Code of Online conduct, which outlines permissible and unacceptable behavior. The board is cognizant and responsive to the risks of technology and seems dedicated to using technology to support student learning only, even if that limits the potential technology use in the school. There are increasing expectations for the integration of Information and Communications Technologies in the classroom. However, the TDSB recognizes that although the appropriate use of technology can enable powerful teaching practices, inappropriate use can cause system failure, and can impede teaching and learning.\n",
      "            I have an interesting perspective on technology use at Cosburn, because my placement was in the library. My Associate Teacher said that there was a push for her to incorporate technology as part of the library program, however this was not evident in our programming. There was a library website with programs such as “story bird,” which was used, but it was not a consistent aspect of the program. However, the library was lucky enough to receive funding for twenty iPads, which will hopefully be utilized to enhance student learning. There was a computer lab across from the library that was used, by some teachers more than others. Ten teachers had their own class web sites. However, there didn’t seem to be any consistent technology initiatives across the school. It also didn’t appear to be the school priority. Technology was not mentioned at any of the school improvement meetings, in any of the school newsletters or on the school website. I would say this reflects the board’s policies. There is an overall push to incorporate more technology to enhance students learning, but both the school and the board has not yet succeeded at implementing and incorporating technology in a consistent and effective way to support student learning.\n",

      "  The TDSB has a board-wide policy that addresses computer and internet use in schools by students and TDSB employees. The Code of Online Conduct outlines rules and guidelines for internet/computer use that focus on personal safety, unacceptable websites and materials, prohibited uses and activities, online publishing, consequences, and liabilities. The Code of Online Conduct also includes a template for a student declaration form that requires students and their parent/guardians to sign and agree to the rules of the policy.\n",

These guidelines and consequences were also clearly outlined in the front pages of the Pierre Laporte student agenda.\n",

Cell phones, mp3 players, cameras, handheld game consoles, and other electronics were to be kept stored in student lockers. Students were discouraged from using their devices during lunch, as well as from even bringing these electronics to school, due to theft and lost valuables issues. Any students caught using personal electronic devices during school hours would have their electronics confiscated for the day. Although this rule was followed quite strictly as a school, there were some teachers that allowed students to bring personal mp3 players to listen to music while doing work as a reward for good behaviour. This policy regarding personal electronic devices was also clearly stated at the front of the student agenda.\n",

This was my first placement with TDSB. While this placement school did not have as much technology equipment as my previous experiences, they made a conscious effort to integrate their technological resources into classrooms. This paper will discuss the use of technology within Brookside P.S. and the TDSB. The use of technology in a school-wide setting will be interpreted through Brookside’s mission statement, technological resources and classroom integration. Finally, school board policies will be dissected in order to understand technological integration on a macro scale.\n",
      "          Brookside P.S. is unique from most other elementary schools due to its commitment to the environment and integrating technology. Brookside has been recognized and awarded for its dedication to teaching environmental responsibility. This value is engrained as deep as the schools mission statement. Technology, on the other hand, is a both a challenge and a priority to the school. Brookside P.S. has a limited amount of technological resources. In their mission statement it states that their education “is geared towards the use of technology”. This mission is met inconsistently due to its limited resources. Their classroom computers are outdated and virtually non-operational during lessons. The school also has eight Smartboards that are shared and rotated on a monthly schedule. This means teachers can only integrate the Smartboard for two months of the school year.\n",
      "           While the resources create a challenge to consistently meet their mission towards integrating technology, the school policies, parent newsletters and encouragement of their faculty effectively incorporates some technology as an aspect of the school community. The teachers are urged to integrate technology within and beyond the four walls of the classroom. Early in the school year, teachers began contacting parents through e-mail to seek approval to use social media programs such ad Edmodo, Glogster and Blogger with their students. Communication with parents is primarily digital. Social media is encouraged with the conditions that the setting is safe and monitored by a parent, guardian or teacher. Students must also adhere to the school boards online code of conduct. Brookside is evolving its mission regarding technology to further integrate social media, yet the TDSB is late in following these expectations and standards.\n",
      "          The TDSB explains that the use of technology must be relevant and suitable to student achievement. In their statement on their technology infrastructure, they explain that, “the appropriate use of technology in schools to enable powerful teaching practices has been increasingly recognized as a force in education to excite student learning”. This begs the question of what is considered to be appropriate uses of technology in school. The TDSB explains that they have “60,000 desktop computers, 1,200 laptop computers, 700 PDAs...” While they focus on the hardware supplied, they neglect to discuss their integration of social media. Social media is an enormous aspect of teaching with technology, and cannot be overlooked. The TDSB is specific in outlining the limitations of technology, rather than the multitude of its uses. It continues to appear as if it fears the outcomes or influences of the fully integrated classroom. By having students sign their agenda’s code of online conduct, and receive lectures from both teachers and administration about adhering to a growing list of rules and regulations on students’ technology use; the school board is in fact segregating itself from their invested technology.\n",

      "  This practicum I was placed in the York Region school board at Fossil Hill Public School. Compared to other schools I have been placed in, the technology at this school was abundant. They had an excellent system set up. This system revolved around the idea of “pods”. Every 4 or 5 classrooms shared a pod which was a room located in the middle of all of the other classrooms. This pod was designated for technology use. In the pods there were 2 sets of desktops, a cart of laptops, a smart board, and a technology cart (equipped with speakers, laptop, elmo, etc.). All the classrooms took full advantage of the pod and it seemed to be a wonderful space for learning.\n",
      "  After reading through the students’ agenda, specifically the section on technology, it is obvious that the schools’ policies related to technology are there to ensure the safety of the students and support a healthy learning environment.\n",
      "  There are two sections in the technologies policies. The first section, computer usage, speaks to the use of computers for curriculum purposes. Students are not allowed to have access to social networking sites, chat rooms, etc. Throughout the practicum I came across a couple sites that were blocked (for example Sporcle –a trivia website) which I planned to use in my lessons. Although initially they were blocked, this was not a problem. There is lots of tech at this school. Some teachers and administrative staff have the ability to unblock sites for learning purposes. Consequently, this policy did not interfere with my teaching or the student learning.\n",
      "  The second policy looks at Internet safety. This policy stems from the concern of student safety. For example, ensuring that students do not give out personal information or pictures over the Internet. Policies such as this are integral to keeping students safe. Throughout my practicum I would give my students assignments on the computer, although I was circulating, I could not see what the students were doing on the computer all the time. Between monitoring the websites students visit and preparing them with safety rules, technology use at this school definitely supported student learning.\n",
      "  The York Region District School Board’s technology policies are very explicit in their explanations. The school outlines most of the board policies, however, the board does go into much more detail. The one discrepancy I found was the use of social networking sites. While Fossil Hill blocks some of these sites, the board permits their use as long as it is for educational purposes. Throughout my years at OISE I have learned many practical strategies for the use of social networking sites in schools. For example, twitter, this site can be used to demonstrate learning after a presentation, share ideas with classmates, or practice writing ideas in a condensed fashion. I am glad to see that the board recognizes the importance of these websites.\n",
      "  Overall this school impressed me with their use of technology. Their unique set-up and adherence to the board and school policies produced an effective and safe learning environment for all the students.\n",

      "8,853,1,,\n",
      "8,854,1,  All of my practicums to date have taken place in Toronto District School Board (TDSB) middle schools, so my experience with technology in the classroom/school has been relatively similar during all three placements.  During this past placement I was at Oakdale Park Middle School.  There are approximately 550 students that attend Oakdale between grade 6 and grade 8.  What I observed was that the classroom I was placed in was the only classroom with access to a SMARTboard.  However, all classrooms had access to one laptop and projector to be used primarily by the teacher during lessons.  In addition there was 1 set of laptops (approximately 20) that were assigned to the grade 8 classes.  The rest of the school was expected to share the computer lab (approximately 30 computers).  Each class was only scheduled one time per week in the computer lab for a one-hour class.  It is worth noting however, that in addition to a limited amount time in the lab, the lab was in very poor condition with many computers either missing a keyboard and/or mouse and in some cases computers were not working at all.\n",
      "  Further, the demographic of the majority of the students that attend Oakdale Park are students who live in mixed housing and who do not have access to computers and other technology devices at home.  Over the course of my placement I asked students to print pieces of final work and discovered just how difficult it was for some students to gain access to a computer, let alone one with a working printer.  Further, I worked with my grade 6 social studies class to prepare PowerPoint presentations.  I was surprised at how technologically illiterate most of the students were.\n",
      "  The TDSB policy on technology speaks to a commitment to provide students with access to technology in the school, as there is an understanding that some students do not have access to technology at home.  TDSB aims to “give students with little or no access to technology an edge to compete with children coming from more affluent homes where technology is available.  Consequently, the board guarantees access to affordable education technology for all classrooms (Technology Infrastructure).  Additionally, the TDSB Classroom Technology Migration Initiative (CTMI) “establishes the framework for a supportable, advanced, and secured on-line learning environment.”  However, in my experience at Oakdale Park, the TDSB has not successfully reached its goals.  While each individual student has access to a login number to save work, there are not enough resources in the school for students to truly become technologically literate and gain the necessary skills “that will transform the way they learn and help prepare them for how they’ll use technology in their future careers” (Increasing Access to Technology).\n",
      "  Lastly, the TDSB has made a commitment to deliver “nearly 18,000 laptops…to more than 360 schools across the board” for students ranging from Kindergarten to Grade 12 (Increasing Access to Technology).  While I may sound cynical, I am truly disheartened by what I have seen in regards to technology with the TDSB.  I believe it is going to take more than a commitment to access to laptops to truly make the TDSB students competitive in the digital age.  Compared to the Peel District School Board, for instance which is pushing BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) to school to promote the use of technology in students’ everyday lives, I feel the TDSB is far behind and as a result is a disservice to the students.\n",

      "8,856,5,Here is my lesson (sort of unit) for Visual Arts, titled: Portraiture: Proportions & Personality. I taught this to grades 6, 7, and 8. I have included an attachment of the power point that I created and used in the introductory part to the unit (the last slide was a black and white photograph of myself  that i used to draw the lines of facial proportions along with the students, but i deleted it to post here). As well, the photographs of student work are embedded in my lesson plan, one from each grade (since their tasks were all a bit different). I also attached a photograph of scaffolding steps that I put on chart paper and hung in the classroom as the students worked on their portraits.\n",
      "  For the famous artists' works that i used and referred to in my lesson, please see the power point. ,\n",
      "8,857,1,              For this term I was placed at Northlea Elementary and Middle School, which is part of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB).  Northlea is a K-8 school and is located at Bayview Ave. and Eglinton Ave. in quite an affluent area of Toronto.  The school is equipped with approximately 5 SMARTboards, which are shared throughout the school, a permanent SMARTboard in the Special Education Primary/Junior D.D. class, a permanent Promethean Board in the Special Education Junior/Intermediate D.D. class, netbooks, laptops, approximately 30 computers in the library, and readily available internet access.  As well, there is a language lab that houses assistive technologies for students with special needs (i.e., speech feedback, talking dictionaries, word prediction, and audio file creation).  In addition to the technologies provided at school it is clear that many of the students have technology readily available at home.\n",
      "          While in my placement I was working in the Spec. Ed J/I D.D. class where unlike the other students in the school, these 9 students did not commute to school from the affluent neighbourhood, and not all of them had direct access to different technologies at home or personally.  However, one student had an mp3 player that was found in his desk and that he took out in class twice throughout my time there.  My AT reminded the student that during that day while at school, as well as on field trips, personal devices (cell phones, ipods, mp3 players, etc) are not to be used and are to remain in their backpacks.  This policy is clearly outlined in the front portion of the students’ agendas, under the section entitled Cell Phone and Electronic Devices, where it states that all devices should remain in the students backpacks while in school or at school related events.  I was also present for the confiscation of cell phones from certain students during the school dance that I helped to supervise.  Finally, during the first week of observation the Principal held an assembly to go over the student agenda, which included talking about the technology policies.\n",
      "          In being able to witness each of these events it became clear that the students of the school are aware of the policies in place in regards to technology and that the school reinforces them in all situations.  Although the incidents described above may seem as though technology is a nuisance in classrooms, I believe that technology enhances student learning.  The opportunity to use the Promethean board, see students at work on the computers and use adaptive technologies, made it quite clear how relevant and helpful technology truly is, in both the special education program and throughout the rest of the school.\n",
      "          There was no clear “advertising” throughout the school that displayed the school’s technology policies.  I was made aware of it in my AT’s school binder, which included the TDSB’s Code of Online-Conduct form.  This form discusses the appropriate use of technologies, such as websites, chatting, etc and what is appropriate and what is not appropriate for staff, students, and teachers.  During my observation week in September the form went home and was to be signed by the students and their parents.  The final tool that was used to discuss technology policies appears on the schools website under Cyberbullying Safety, which discusses signs, symptoms, how to deal with cyberbullying, as well as Tips for Parents.  As well as the section under Other Information: Electronic Devices, which discusses the appropriate use of personal student devices and the rules when in possession of such devices within the school.\n",
      "          Although there are many issues related to technology, I still believe that technology enhances student learning.  I used the Promethean Board on a daily basis, and engaged the students and provided them with hands on opportunities to engage with the technology.  Thus furthering their understanding and allowing them to express their knowledge in alternative ways.  This was specifically helpful for those students in my class who were non-verbal.  Through all of this as well as partaking in their computer lab classes, it was clear that technology helped, my students specifically, a great deal.  In the future I plan on implementing technology where I can in my teaching, but believe it is important to review the TDSB’s as well as the school’s specific technology policies.  Northlea had very few issues with technology during my stay, therefore supporting the success of their policies.\n",

      "8,859,1,     This practicum, I was placed in a grade 4 French immersion class at Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in the York Region District School Board (YRDSB).  I noticed that the majority of the teachers in the school frequently used technology.   Although one of my placements last year was also in YRDSB, there was much more technology available at this school including SMARTboards, laptops, document cameras, ipads, and computer labs, than at my previous practicum school where I used only an overhead projector.\n",
      "          The board’s policy #194.0 called “Appropriate use of technology” outlines the terms under which technology should be used in schools.   The policy indicates that the board supports the use of technology in schools and that not only can technology support daily operating activities, but also benefit student achievement.  The guidelines found in the policy document apply to all members of the school community, including superintendents, principals, teachers, and students, who are all users of technology.  The document also clearly outlines irresponsible and unethical use of technology as well as a description of social networking sites.\n",
      "       During practicum, I did not notice any posters or information around the school about acceptable use of technology, however, during the first week of school, a letter named “Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement” was sent home with the students.  The letter outlines the expectations for students surrounding the use of technology, including respectful, responsible use and the reporting of problems.  The letter must be signed by both the student and the parent and returned to the school.  Although there were no advertisements in the school about appropriate usage, the school has a “Security Awareness” section available on their website.  Provided on this page are multiple links to interactive games that quiz the students about topics such as meeting people online, file-sharing, spyware and others.\n",
      "       In my classroom, I did not find that there was much discussion surrounding rules when using technology and the Internet.  During work on the computers, this did not seem to be a problem and the students worked well.   However, we encountered a small problem when my associate teacher introduced the students to the website Kidblog.  The students were required to write a personal response to a reflection question at home for homework.  No expectations were outlined with respect to appropriate use of the website.  A couple of days later, there was a supply teacher in and that evening, my associate teacher noticed that the students had been using the site to discuss how they felt about the supply teacher that day.  We then had to have a discussion with the students about using the site only for the purpose that had been outlined.  This event made it clear to me that no matter the age of your students, it is always important to explicitly identify the specific guidelines for any new technology that is being introduced to students.  This practicum opened my eyes to the various ways that technology is being used in schools, and I enjoyed having the opportunity to explore this in my teaching practices.\n",

      "8,864,5,Through discussion with my associate teacher regarding Fossil Hill elementary school's technology policies, I was recommended to review the school agenda and the York Region District School board (YRDSB) website for board documents. After looking at the Appropriate Use of Technology document, I believe that YRDSB understands that technology is a growing and important part of today's society and schools. However, the document itself (and the Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement) are more concerned with the rules and regulations of what is and is not allowed in the classroom when using technology (i.e. using computers in a proper manner, no sharing private information). To ensure appropriateness, these documents outline the responsibilities for all members of the school community when using technology in the classroom. Of significant note, the Appropriate Use of Technology document states that it is the accountability of the faculty (teachers, principals) to ensure that students are using technology properly. This allows teachers the freedom to promote technology in the classroom. Therefore, if students had a teacher that was more tech savvy, then (in theory) the technological possibilities for student learning are enhanced. Unless the teacher is doing something with technology that is unethical, teachers have the ability to use technology in many ways to assist the learning needs of students. Fossil Hill itself is very proactive in using technology to enhance student learning and the school encourages students to experiment with technology provided that they treat all technological devices with respect. Fossil Hill has a wide array of technological devices, such as laptops, Smartboards, iPads, and document cameras, that are used by teachers and students constantly in their classrooms. This would not be possible if YRDSB did not promote the use of technology.\n",
      "  Similarly, the school agenda provides various rules and regulations for students to follow when using technology. Although, the school agenda mirrors the Appropriate Use of Technology document closely, there are two exceptions. Although the Appropriate Use of Technology document does not limit the use of social networking sites (as long as they are supervised by a teacher), the agenda clearly states that no social networking sites be used in school. Furthermore, Fossil Hill strongly discourages students from bringing their personal music players, cell phones or other technological equipment. These rules are implemented by Fossil Hill due to the safety concerns of the students; it does limit student learning as social network sites could have beneficial uses.\n",
      "  In future, I would strongly recommend that both the Appropriate Use of Technology document and the school agenda provide a section that discusses what students are allowed to do when using technology. My associate teacher happened to be the technology lead of the school and his students were strongly encouraged to use technology. If however a school did not have these technological devices nor faculty promoting technology, then student learning would be limited. The Appropriate Use of Technology document should better outline what they consider to be appropriate (and should state that they are not limited to these rules) so students have a stronger idea of how to use technology taking some of the onus away from the teacher. These documents should focus more on the \"do's\" and to a lesser extent the \"do not's\".\n",

      "8,866,10,    Observation week set the ground rules and policies regarding technology use in the York Catholic District School Board. On the first day of school, the school community gathered in the gymnasium to welcome students to the start of a new school year and of course, review some of the school’s policies with respect to technology and personal electronic devices. Interestingly, the school principal posed a challenge in which each student created a visual poster that informs students that PEDs are to be “off and invisible”. This slogan resonated through the school hallways and in conversation with my Associate Teacher; I learned that this slogan was established over two years ago to remind students of the strict policy regarding PEDs. Students anxiously created their visual posters to enter into the school competition. The top posters were selected from each classroom and the administrative team selected the winner. While observing my students create their posters, it struck me how one student wrote as their slogan: “Cell phones OFF keeps learning ON”. It troubles me to think that learning and technology are viewed in isolation from one another.\n",
      "      The York Catholic District School Board’s policy regarding Personal Electronic Devices states that all PEDs must be out-of-site during the school day unless the school principal grants special permission. During my observation week, parents/guardians were asked to sign a consent form to acknowledge that students are not permitted PEDs during the school day. Also, parents/guardians were asked to review safe and proper use of technology with their children (i.e. the internet, social media) at the start of the school year. These guidelines are listed in the Parent Handbook that is sent home with students during the first week of school.\n",
      "      At my placement school, each classroom teacher had access to a Promethean Board. Some teachers frequently utilized the tool while others never received training on how to effectively use it in their instructional practice. The first time my students were exposed to the interactive whiteboard was through my own teaching. Through some of my lessons, students had the opportunity to create concept maps and access YouTube videos to facilitate their understanding of concepts. In addition, the school has access to one computer lab of approximately twenty-five computers. Teachers have one 45-minute period a week to bring their students to the lab. A rotation schedule was established during the first week of school.\n",
      "     “The YCDSB is committed to providing all students access to the curriculum through the use of assistive technology” (YCDSB website). It is evident that the board is committed to offering assistive technologies for a wide range of learners. Several students in my Grade 4 class were offered frequent one-on-one support through programs like Kurzweil 3000, Inspiration, and Dragon Naturally Speaking Professional. In conclusion, my placement school is committed to student learning through the use of assistive technologies however; the school board strongly regulates the use of PEDs to prevent their negative impacts on the school environment.\n",

      "8,867,2,During my practicum at St. Francis of Assisi Elementary School, I was pleased to see that the TCDSB recognizes the changing nature and increasing use of technology by students and teachers.        Technology was widely used at the school – each class had a SMART board, intermediate classes shared 30 netbooks, there was school-wide wifi, in my LD class there were computers with adaptive technology, and students could play educational games online. All teachers used technology to differentiate their instruction.\n",
      "            Students and parents were required to sign the TCDSB Acceptable Use Policy for Technology, Student Internet Agreement form (see attached), which relates to the Acceptable Use Policy (A.29) (AUP).  The AUP governs the use of social media, website publishing and personal electronic devices (PEDs), outlines restrictions like cyber-bullying and states that students’ use of technology at school is a privilege, not a right.\n",
      "            In September 2012, the TCDSB enacted the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy which states that PEDs, including cell phones and laptops, are not mandatory in school, but may be used if there is a clear educational purpose. The BYOD allows administrators and teachers to decide the terms of appropriate use. My Associate Teacher’s rule is that PEDs can’t be used during class unless permission is granted, and if a student is caught, their PED will be taken away until the end of the day. As ringing cell phones were an issue and distraction in my classroom, I felt that taking a phone away was a suitable solution.\n",
      "            Overall, I strongly support the TCDSB’s policies and I believe that they serve the best interest of students, support their learning, and help students become responsible technology users. Both the policies and technology in general aid student learning because they leveled the playing field for many of my students and allowed me to teach more effectively with all abilities and multiple intelligences in mind.  For example, in one math class I was able to use adaptive technology, the SMART Board, online math games and calculators on PEDs to make sure that all students in my class understood the lesson and could appropriately and independently practice using the skills we learned.\n",
      "            I believe that all students still have a right to access technology that belongs to the school. I fear that if school boards begin to think that students are capable of providing their own learning resources/technology, they will fund school technology less, which will impede the learning of many students, particularly students of low socio-economic status and students with special needs.\n",
      "            I also believe that the policies could in fact be implemented in inequitable ways if teachers and schools are not careful. In my practicum, while one student benefitted from using organizational apps on his iPod, I saw another student become extremely frustrated because he didn’t have anything additional to use when the computers in the class were broken or being used by another student. Also, there were times when other classes needed the netbooks, or when it took weeks for a technician to fix technology, so not all of my students had the adaptive tools they needed.  In these instances, I found that the policies were inequitable in my class of special needs students, and I believe that these issues should be addressed going forward in a timely manner so that all students benefit from technology use in schools.\n",

      "8,872,1,  YRDSB Policy #194, “Appropriate Use of Technology”, recognizes that technology can benefit student learning and outline the conditions for appropriate use of technology, as well as the responsibilities of teachers, principles, superintendents, and students. The definition of appropriate use is common-sense and fairly broad. It includes using technology in a “responsible and ethical manner consistent with the educational, informational and recreational purposes for which they are provided”. Teachers are expected to instruct model appropriate use to students. Teachers are specifically cautioned that if they use social networking technologies they should ensure they have appropriate understanding of effective educational use of such technologies, and avoid personal uses of such technologies when communicating with students or parents.\n",
      "  In addition, all students and parents at Bond Lake Public School are expected to sign the Information Technology Acceptable Use Agreement. This agreement states that student are accountable for respecting others' personal information and privacy, abiding by school code of conduct and safe school policy, protecting their personal information, using school technology responsibly for educational purposes as determined by a teacher, and respecting school technology. Parents are advised to learn more about safe schools policy and internet safety on the board's website.\n",
      "  The board's website contains guide for parents and guardians on cyber-bullying, including its definition, statistics, legal implications, and advice on what parents/guardians can do if their children are being cyber-bullied or are cyber-bullying someone.\n",
      "  On the positive side, the school policies are fairly broad and provide teachers with a lot of room for professional judgement. This support teachers who are interested to integrate technology to their teaching and are confident in their proficiency to do so. However, other than a generic statement that technology can support student learning, the policy does not require teachers to integrate technology in any way, nor does it require teachers to become trained to do so. This means that students' exposure to various technologies as part of their schooling is highly dependent on the specific teachers they have. While I believe that providing teacher's with autonomy is beneficial for teaching, I would like to see some board level or provincial guidelines regarding technological proficiency benchmarks that students should acquire during their schooling.\n",
      "  Regarding the safe school policies and the student agreement, I feel that current policies are not effective in educating students about cyber-bullying. The students are expected to sign an agreement that is rather vague and is not written in a student friendly-language. In addition, some of the parents who are not fluent in English may not be able to fully understand the implications of cyber-bullying and may not be able to take the preventative measures offered by the board. I fear that without further action, these policies may become mere lip-service to the issue. I would recommend to revise the policy so that each student would be required to complete an age-appropriate online module on cyber-bullying and appropriate use of technology as a condition to be granted access to board's technology.\n",

      "8,873,2,        Last week I finished my fall practicum at Wedgwood Junior School (TDSB) teaching Kindergarten to Grade 5 Physical Education and Health. Upon my initial observation I noticed a computer lab located in the school library and a Smart-board in each of the grade 4 and 5 classrooms as well as the Homeschool Program (HSP) classroom. Throughout my time at Wedgewood I also learned of something called the Lego League. The Lego League took place at lunch with the goal of the program being to empower students through science and technology.\n",
      "   “The program is to provide an inspirational learning experience for children by celebrating science and technology, and combining educational context with hands-on challenges that empower children to create their own theories and solutions.”(Wedgewood Home Website)\n",
      "  The overall reaction from the students was outstanding, they were able to manipulate the Lego (something that they were familiar with) with the use of technology. They used trial an error strategies to create and recreate a variety of moving structures and mini-robots.\n",
      "              In teaching in the 21st century it is apparent that technology does indeed have the power to enhance learning. However, diverse classrooms within the TDSB present families that range in socio-economic status. Technology isn’t always available at home and it can vary (example: from no technology, to a Windows 95 computer, to a brand new I-pad). How can educators bridge the gap between students who have access to technology at home, compared to students who do not? The Toronto District School Board states:\n",
      "  “Access to current education technology at school can give students with little or no access to technology an edge to compete with children coming from more affluent homes where technology is available. Guaranteeing access for all classrooms to affordable education technology in order to achieve curricular goals helps to address the inequities that exist among schools and districts in the availability of instructional resources.”(TDSB Website)\n",
      "             It is our Job as educators to create a positive and inclusive learning environment for all of students, as in all subjects we must be aware of our students needs and individual abilities. From my personal experience as a teacher, technology has helped engage my students, and it has allowed them to explore concepts in different ways. One of the greatest complements I received when leaving Wedgewood was from a grade 5 student. He said, “Mr. Lekas before you taught science we used to hate it, but you made it fun.” I taught the entire science unit on the Human Organ System using the smart-board, making the unit as interactive as possible. Without this form of technology I don’t think the unit would be as ‘fun’ as it turned out to be. Technology doesn’t only engage students but it can also enrich learning. Technologies such as the smart-board and programs such as the Lego League assist teachers with differentiated instruction allowing students to learn in a number of ways, which in turn promotes students to be curious, ask questions, and make sense of the world.\n",

      "  The M.T. program has explicitly and implicitly supported our attendance at the TORF, and I think there is a significant minority of Year 2s planning to apply to and attend the resource fair.

      "8,880,2,I became aware of the extensive technology-related policies and procedures that exist within the York Catholic District School Board (YCDSB) during my placement at a small school with a tightly-knit community, St. Joseph the Worker Catholic School. Students attending this school ranged from JK-Grade 8 and my placement was in a Grade 8 classroom.\n",
      "  During observation week, I became familiar with the technology utilized at the school, the technological resources available for use by teachers and students, and the technology-related policies and procedures that were in place. I quickly became aware of the lack of technological resources at the school. In my classroom, there were three large and dated desktop computers and one bulky overhead projector. Only one cart was available for rent from the library and this cart held a large and dated laptop and a projector. I did not notice any SMARTboards in the entire school and most classrooms had blackboards rather than whiteboards. My classroom was one of the few classrooms that had computers and often times, students from different grades came into the classroom to work on the computers. The library was equipped with 30 bulky and dated desktop computers that operated slowly. Bringing my students into the library for a research session was unproductive due to the poor Internet connection and the dated software on the computers. It was from my initial tour of the library during observation week that I had a gut feeling that the computers were in poor working condition and would not have the up-to-date software that I was used to using at school and at home.\n",
      "  Prior to this placement, I had just begun feeling comfortable and confident enough in utilizing the SMARTboard and its many features to conduct my own lessons. Once at St. Joe’s, I was disappointed that I would not be able to practice my recently acquired technology skills nor would I be able to work on and practice using current technological resources, essentially I felt that my teaching would be lagging behind in the technology trend.\n",
      "  YCDSB’s technology-related policies and procedures became apparent to me when technology-related agreement forms were sent home in September. All students receiving education in the YCDSB and their parents/guardians, “...will sign annually the grade appropriate Student Acceptable Use of Information Technology Agreement prior to accessing Board information technology, either at school or remotely” (Policy #311). At St. Joe’s, I saw two such forms, one for students in JK-Grade 3 and another form for students in Grades 4-8, whereby the number of agreements are greater for those students in the Junior and Intermediate divisions. A related policy #408 is aimed at teachers and their use of information technology.\n",
      "  My associate teacher implemented his own rules related to cell phone use. Upon entering of his classroom, all cell phones were to be either put on silence or turned off, and at the start of each school day, cell phones needed to be placed in a basket that was stored in the classroom closet until the end of the day. YCDSB’s policy #222 speaks to this, stating that for students in elementary grades, “all personal electronic devices (PEDs) carried by students shall be kept out-of-sight, turned off and not used during the day” unless authorized by the principal.\n",

      "8,905,1,  At Windfields Junior High technology is present in each classroom in the form of desktop computers frequent use of projectors and smart boards and often individual student laptops.  Students are expected to have a working printer at home or to utilize the school library and labs to print out items outside of class time.  My AT (and myself) had the policy that not having work printed on the date that it was due made the assignment 'late'.  This was a universally accepted practice within the school, and is said to have been recognized as this is a more 'affluent' area and as such students should have access to technology and printer at home.  This is a slightly controversial stance as it does not quite mesh with TDSB and their equity processes of student access.  Though all students should have access to computers and to technology for the purpose of handing in work this means that students who are not privileged to have working tech at home have to use their mornings or 'break' times to make that occur.\n",
      "  Windfields also followed the BYOD device policy of the TDSB but frequently I saw students handing their phones into a bin as to not be distracted or being questioned as to why they were using their phone at silent reading time.    I rarely saw teachers ask students to bring out their devices to augment learning and was shocked with the cheers and the surprise when I said students could listen to music if they wanted to during a work period class I had taught. In fact phones were seen as being something of a curse in many classrooms even though sometimes students were looking up what something meant or something that interested them from the lecture.\n",
      "  As well as questions of equity access and BYOD there was also the online code of conduct that applied to students and students had frequent presentations about online bullying and cyber bullying during my practicum.  In fact many other presenters for other topics touched on online safety and students were eager to reference online media and to talk about worst case scenarios.  In my class we didn't use the computer lab too frequently and as we had about seven computers in our class and the smart board it was quite rare we needed ndividual computers but in 'supporting' a work session in a computer lab the teacher did grill each student on the rules of the (falling apart and dusty) lab and what would occur if they didn't use the technology appropriately.\n",

      "8,920,7,     During my practicum at Upper Canada College, I had the great opportunity to take on the role of assisting the head ICT integrator in various projects, from leading his pilot study on digital student response systems in my own science classes to co-facilitating a Latin teacher’s adoption of iPad-mirroring to replace the SMART Board. While such initiatives may arise in isolation within academic departments, teachers keep in mind that their implementation is made possible by virtue of UCC’s dedicated network, and more recently, a mandatory 1:1 laptop program. As a corollary, UCC’s entire technological infrastructure—including policies and practices—is maintained solely by its own IT and ICT integration departments.\n",
      "      The immediate advantage of this autonomy is that the policies are developed with the school’s idiosyncrasies in mind, including UCC’s recent registration with a Google domain (highlighting a school-wide shift towards cloud computing), the boarding community, a highly layered organizational structure within the faculty, and other factors. For example, the 1:1 program necessitates a protocol for retrieving lost laptops that seamlessly integrate with the school’s own communication infrastructure:\n",
      "    This is contrasted with board-wide policies such as the TDSB’s Code of On-Line Conduct and PDSB’s Use of Technology Code that can only practically focus on universal human elements of ethical use, personal safety, and access to inappropriate material. With a specificity that is relevant to the school in its wholeness, UCC’s policy also implies a student-cultural influence towards technology’s true integration into school life, rather than being just a tool that needs to be booked in advance and monitored during work periods in the library.\n",
      "      For example, the Student Laptop and Network Agreement provides guidelines on battery maintenance, serving a dual purpose of teaching good practice in computer care and minimizing disruptions to learning.\n",
      "    Disruptions to learning due to technology are less considered a matter of classroom management, as students are generally allowed to turn on their laptops during a lecture with the trust that they do not violate school code (as well as the canonical expectations upheld throughout board policies). This trust is acknowledged by signing UCC’s Acceptable Use of Technology Student Agreement form.\n",
      "      Arguably the best known role of UCC’s IT Department among students is as a passive enforcer through web surveillance and defense. The network is configured to send files of unknown formats through an automated scanning-and-approval procedure. As well, websites considered to host inappropriate material (games, pornography, gambling, etc.) as well as Facebook are blocked. However, observations of students occasionally accessing gaming sites show that these measures can be imprecise, though it is uncertain whether a more robust measure is possible. Furthermore, such measures could potentially have the opposite effect; students in a computer programming class have been hindered in a unit on game development, and an innovative teacher once experienced difficulty retrieving a file to supplement his otherwise technologically-enhanced lesson.\n",
      "      All in all, implementing a 1:1 laptop program profoundly enhanced the learning experience for students in all aspects of academic and educational life. It may be obvious that the merits of technological integration are greater than the sum of their parts; these merits are not strictly additive, for as with just about any new system, technology needs to be in the right setting to be valuable and viable. UCC’s thoughtfully-planned policy on technological use is but one indicator of that. â–\n",

      "8,925,6,Considering that for the last few days we have been talking about dance (or just dancing), I thought that I would share my own thoughts of why dance is an important part of life.\n",
      "  Dancing has many forms and styles such as: hip hop, salsa, merange, cha cha, tango, jazz, broadway, crump, bachata, dancehall, foxtrot, tap, capoeria, and so on. What I find special about dance is that each style has its own roots and origins that can be traced back to different cultures. Dance is interconnected, intertwined, and can cross different cultures and backgrounds. Salsa, for example, is a dance whose origin comes from the dance styles of African Rumbas. It is hugely popular in South America, but is also can be seen in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. When I was first introduced to Salsa, my instructor was of Irananian descent. Through Salsa we became friiends and are still friends to this day. Furthermore, going to salsa clubs introduced me to people of different races and nationalities; all with a love of salsa. I strongly  believe that dance has the power to bring people together from all walks of life. I use salsa as an example because of my own experiences, but I strongly feel that all forms of dance has this same power.\n",
      "  Secondly, there are many reasons why people dance, all of which are valid and imporant. Some people dance because it is fun to do. Others may dance as a way to exercise and become physically fit. And then there are those people that dance because \"they need to dance\". You may have heard stories from people who say that \"dance saved my life\". This is so true. I was watching the TV show \"So You Think You Can Dance\" over the summer and I watched an overweight man audition for the show. He explained to the judges that he is the only male member of his family not either in jail or doing drugs. He believed that it was through dance that allowed him to escape this possible life. This is just one of the many stories that I have heard about how dance has become peoples escape.\n",
      "  Another story that affected me was a man who wanted to dance as his career, but whose father did not support this (and his) \"lifestyle\". To rob people of the ability to dance is (to me) a crime. Dance is an extension of body and mind, and each dance movement can emit emotion and expression. To take away the power of expression, freedom, and release would be wrong.\n",
      "  Although I could talk much longer about dance, I want to wrap up this comment by two quotes:\n",
      "  “Let us read, and let us dance; these two amusements will never do any harm to the world.” - Voltaire\n",
      "  “Dance, when you're broken open. Dance, if you've torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you're perfectly free.” - Rumi\n",
      "  And that is why I feel dance is an important part of life.,\n",

      "  \"… In The Brain That Changes Itself, psychiatrist Norman Doidge explained the brain plasticity principles behind the decreased sexual responsiveness in his heavy porn-using patients (and its reversibility). Yet most doctors who are not neuroscience specialists still hark back to their days of Penthouse use and continue to view Internet porn use as a harmless extension. They seem unaware that today’s porn delivers far more addiction-producing neurochemical stimulation to the brain than static porn of the past, that brain scans of Internet addicts are already revealing standard addiction-related brain changes, or that today’s kids are using Internet porn extensively while their brains are uniquely plastic.\n",
      "  ….\n",
      "The assumption that sexual-behavior addiction is strictly a symptom of some other primary illness produces misleading diagnoses for those wrestling with addiction-related brain changes. These include performance anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression, severe social anxiety, erectile dysfunction, performance anxiety (with one’s hand?), and so forth. Worse yet, the addicted patient is not informed that he may be able to reverse his symptoms by enduring withdrawal and changing behavior. Brain plasticity works both ways.\n",
      "  Researchers know from other behavioral addictions that the symptoms on which such other diagnoses rest can often be a function of addiction itself (anhedonia, concentration problems, severe anxiety, etc.).\",\n",
      "8,930,1,  Beverley Public School's technology policies were not explicit within the school because of the degree of supervision while students used technology, given the special education context. The class sizes of Beverley were small (max of 8 students) and Promethean Boards were used within most classrooms under direct guidance of the teachers or EA's. Students were encouraged to use technology often, and were taught to swipe or tap the Promethean or click on the ipad/itouch icons as gross and fine motor skills assessments. Students received assistance with these functions depending on need, and according to their IEP.\n",
      "  In the TDSB Code for Online Conduct policy, 4.2.1 states that “On a global network such as the Internet it is impossible to effectively control the content of the information. On occasion, users of on-line systems may encounter material that is controversial and which other users, parents or staff might consider inappropriate or offensive. It is the responsibility of the individual user not to intentionally access such material. If such material is accessed by accident, the incident must be reported immediately to a teacher or appropriate authority.” I believe that Beverley was able to uphold this regulation because only the teachers could supervise students when they went onto the internet. Alternately, Wi-fi access was unavailable for students.\n",
      "  Ipad and itouch technologies are currently being researched heavily at Beverley. They used technology for a variety of activities including receptive language programs, visual schedules, expressive communication, circle time, individual educational goals, play or rewards, as well as, transitions. Often students in my class watched music videos on youtube as a way of engaging in free time; indeed, part of their assessment was making choices and taking turns in activities. Technology - specifically work with the ipads or itouch - allowed students to have increased quality of life (they are able to build confidence and reduce anxiety which decreases self harm) and also increase students' ability to communicate their desires.\n",
      "  During my placement, a series on Autism was featured in the Toronto Star. One of the students in the feature, Jasper, was a student who I saw every day toting his ipad around the school. He literally carried it everywhere he went. I never saw him on the internet, but he would play music (including the Black Keys!) and use the App’s downloaded onto his ipad. Many of the App’s on his ipad were featured on the Beverley website as recommended App’s for students at the school with autism.\n",

      "  There are a variety of YRDSB polices which have implications for technology use in YRDSB, some of which are more explicit than others in their ramifications for the classroom teacher.  Some are technology-specific, while others are technology encompassing.  Three in particular, however, warrant highlighting:\n",
      "Board Policy #194.0: Appropriate Use of Technology  (specific)\n",
      "Board Policy #160.0: Records & Information Management, (encompasses) and\n",
      "Board Policy #545.0: Intellectual Property, Copyright and Professional Services (encompasses).\n",
      "Additionally, the government of Ontario has regulations with technology implications, particularly\n",
      "“Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act - R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER M.56” (http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90m56_e.htm) (encompasses) (basically, the public has the right of access of information to anything done on with government funds)\n",
      "  Technology policies are so vast that one assignment couldn’t possibly cover all of the ramifications.  For that reason, I have focused on some issues from the above policies and regulations which impact how the classroom teacher uses technology. In short, from that lens, these policies boil down to five main issues which highlight how YRDSB policies are consistent with others across disciplines and across places of employment, and a sixth which is particular to government or para-government organizations (excerpts from the policies supporting the above points are included below)\n",
      "Nothing you do while on an employers paid time belongs to you, even if it is original work;\n",
      "Anything done on an employer’s equipment, whether technically during work time or not, falls under their policies;\n",
      "Employers won’t protect you if you break the law, even if you believe you were simply engaged in activities supporting your job responsibilities;\n",
      "Employers have the right to see any communications done while under their time, including  but not limited to your board email;\n",
      "Anything produced/stored/transmitted on board equipment has statutory records management policies surrounding their destruction, the contravention of which can place you in a legally compromising position;\n",
      "Additionally, as is common with government or para-government organizations:\n",
      "Anything you create can legally be accessed by a member of the public at any time.\n",
      "  While many would call these common sense, or at least common to most places of employment, I suspect that many teachers would be shocked at the implications of the above statements.  The growth of such organizations as “teachers pay teachers” where there you can sell your lesson plans would technically be prohibited by these YRDSB policies.  The accidental contravention of copyright law can leave you exposed to legal ramifications without protection.  Additionally, any activity on a board laptop, even if done at home, falls under their usage policies, as does any activity on your personal device even if done through your personal 3G account if done during work hours while on board property.  An email containing disparaging comments about a parent may be accessed not only by your administrator, but also by that parent, if the parent is familiar with the method to request access to information under the “Municipal Freedom of Information” act.\n",
      "  In general, what a review of these policies led me to was a reminder that any technology use while in a school, whether personal or board-specific, brings with it a host of legal ramifications which most classroom teachers have absolutely no understanding of.  Additionally, given increasing pressure from commercial enterprises to penalize even trivial copyright contravention, the above issues are extremely pertinent.  It is difficult to convince teachers to increase their use of technology when it causes them to be exposed to a plethora of new liabilities which are current insufficiently explored.  As such, if these policies are not accompanied by professional development, they have the potential to hinder technology uptake by teachers.\n",

      "  Bickmore's (2010) study illustrates different methodologies aimed at reducing violence and promoting inclusion within schools. She highlights three varieties of anti-violence work: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding. The first two are seen as means toward \"negative peace\", a necessary but insufficient condition of democracy, whereas effective peacebuilding measures can intervene in institutional structures to provide a truly equitable space.\n",
      "  Peacekeeping strategies generally consist of safety and security measures, exemplified here by peer monitor programs. One major obstacle to equity is that the \"peers\" may be selected by teachers or administration based on pre-ordained attributes, and their responsibilities might reinforce pre-existing disparities in power and/or status.\n",
      "  Peacemaking through explicit conflict resolution education may entail any number of strategies but the most well-researched method is peer mediation, which fosters academic achievement in addition to its goal of nonviolence. In some cases, mediators are small \"cadres\" of leaders, and sometimes it is a whole-class or -school endeavour, built into the curriculum.\n",
      "  Peacebuilding refers to a process of developing and restoring equitable, healthy relationships, which can be achieved through \"well-facilitated, open and inclusive discussion of meaningful issues\" (Bickmore, 2010). For such action to be effective, a diverse group of students must be able to \"exercise democratic agency\" (Bickmore 2010).\n",
      "  The study clarifies the imperative of student self-governance and emancipation, and the curricular incorporation of non-violent education.

      "8,967,3,Any way we could group similar apps together? ScreenChomp and Educreations are pretty much the same, as well as a third one called ShowMe.\n",
      "  Some differences I found among the three:\n",
      "  - Educreations and ShowMe allow users to browse and stream videos uploaded by other creators, but ScreenChomp doesn't (ouch!)\n",
      "- Educreations allows you to call up a new page (and revisit old pages of drawings) while you record, and while simulating blank paper, lined paper, grid paper, and Cartesian coordinates, while the others don't. Screenchomp's drawing area is around three times bigger than the other two apps though.\n",
      "- only ShowMe doesn't allow you to import images from DropBox...could be a drawback for certain teachers\n",
      "- only Educreations allows you to input text into your drawing. No idea why the other apps don't have this function\n",
      "- only Educreations's brush is speed-sensitive (i.e. the faster your stroke, the thinner your ink, which emulates real ink on paper...nice aesthetic detail)\n",

      "According to the articles, how do individuals with disabilities continue to be segregated or ignored in both society as well as the education system?\n",
      "  In Kristeva’s article, she mentions that although it has become ‘common sense’ to resist issues such as racism, classism and religious persecution, people living with a disability are often excluded from society and their inclusion is still met with resistance.  Why do you think this is?  What do you think of this issue?  How can we overcome this barrier?\n",
      "  The articles that we read all touch on the idea that the exclusion of individuals with disabilities stems from both the societal dialogue surrounding this issue and the fear of the uncertainty that often accompanies interactions with individuals who have a disability.  What can be done in the classroom to eliminate the fears students may have when it comes to a classmate with a disability?  What strategies can be used to best integrate these students into our classroom?  How can we change the dialogue used when discussing individuals with a disability?    ,\n",
      "8,978,1,Hi everyone here are my questions for tomorrow:\n",
      "    Discussion Questions:\n",
      "1.     How are individuals with disabilities still segregated and/or “ignored” within both the educational system, including University, and society?\n",
      "  2.     In thinking about the idea that a person HAS a disability, and is NOT a disabled person, how do you think the phrasing changes how those who do in fact have a disability are perceived?\n",
      "  3.     In Kristeva’s article At the Limits of Living, she states that resisting racism, classist, and religious persecution has become “the sensible thing to do.”  However, when it comes to the exclusion of those suffering from a disability it is an entirely different story.  Do you think that this remains to be true? If so, how is it evident in the educational system both within the classroom and in the physical layout of educational facilities?\n",
      "  4.     Do you think the term “disability” should be used? Does it create a negative connotation when referring to those that “suffer” from a disability? Finally, because disabilities occur in so many variations and are different from all others dependent on the person, should they be classified under this one, somewhat daunting, term?\n",
      "  5.     According to Titchkosky, “… meanings of disability are generated through talk that justifies the exclusive shape and inaccessible structures of university life.”  Think about how the simplest adjustment in a phrase or definition about those who have a disability can change the way we support and/or provide the appropriate accessibility options for them.  Is this idea of the choice in wording an evident problem in our educational system? Why or why not?\n",
      "  6.     Our interactions with others are some of the most important parts in developing a community, thus affecting society.  Many of the authors suggest that we need to rethink how we interact with those with disabilities and/or differences.  Do you believe this to be true? Furthermore, do you believe that we need to conduct a “rebirth of our thinking” in order for those with disabilities to be a part of society, not just integrated?    ,\n",
      "8,979,1,I've sent my group this summary via email, but I wanted to post this before I left my house:\n",
      "    1) The article: At the Limits of Living: To Joseph Grigely, argues that in order to understand different types of disabilities, we must take into account ideas that originate from psychoanalysis. The article first describes how a filmmaker created a documentary of how to best treat a schizophrenic patient. Although the documentary was successful (many people saw the film and the film was given awards), Julia Kristeva strongly feels that no new insight was found about how to treat schizophrenia as the film did not take into account the schizophrenic patient's point of view. The author suggests that through understanding of unconsciousness, dreams and other psychoanalytical procedures we can better understand disabilities.\n",
      "  Questions:\n",
      "a) Do you feel that consumerist actions (i.e. watching films) help people understand the nature of mental disabilities?\n",
      "b) Do psychoanalytical techniques still play an important role in understanding mental disabilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2) In the article: Minds Between Us: Autism, Mindblindness and the Uncertainty of Communication, Anne E. McGuire & Rod Michalko discuss how autism is thought of as an enigma to the psyche. They strongly believe that this attempt to solve this mystery is the basis for how people treat autism. This idea of wanting to figure out what is missing in the mind stems from the psychological concepts of theory of mind (correlating mental states as predictors for behaviour) and mind-blindness (the deficiency of not predicting ones mental states and behaviour).The authors suggest that people should not think of autism in these concepts, but instead look at trying to understand autism through interactions and communication.\n",
      "  Questions:\n",
      "  a) Should we therefore study autism with a behaviourist approach (study observable behaviour) or should we follow the theory of mind?\n",
      "  b) How can theory of mind and mind-blindness affect our teaching and our own understanding of autism?\n",
      "    3) The third article: The Anguish of Power: Remapping Mental Diversity with an Anticolonial Compass looks at the World Health Organization's (WHO) understanding and treatment of people with mental illness. The WHO's definition of mental illness is whereby the psychological problem is organic in nature. Therefore, WHO believes that mental illness can be cured through treatment (i.e. medicine). However, WHO does not take into consideration various social issues (poverty, racism, unstable family environment). Furthermore, society in itself is not normalized and each country, city, region, have different poverty rates, domesticated areas, and family make-ups. WHO normalizes society when society is itself atypical.\n",
      "    Questions:\n",
      "  a) Are psychological disorders problems with mind, body or both, is treating the mind separate from treating the body?\n",
      "  b) How strongly do you believe that social issues are correlated to mental illness?\n",
      "        4) Although institutions are required to provide a space that is accessible to people with disabilities, the last article: To Pee or Not To Pee, states that even the most accessible places do exclude people with disabilities. As an excuse, people gauge in regular dialogue as a way of justifying why there are inaccessible areas. These excuses have become reasons for not making places accessible to all people. These moments of dialogue need to be looked at so we can better understand how to make places accessible for all such people.\n",
      "  Questions\n",
      "a) How can this line of dialogue affect our teaching and school practices toward disabilities?,\n",

      "Morrison, Robbins, Rose (2008).\n",
      "  This article is essentially a literature review of research into culturally relevant pedagogy.  The authors organized the articles according to the Ladson-Billings framework, which identifies three components of culturally relevant pedagogy: setting High Expectations, developing Cultural Competence, and developing Critical Consciousness.  The authors then examined 45 studies for specific pedagogical strategies that teachers used to achieve these components.  Morrison et al.’s study is a comprehensive base of strategies and tools teachers are using in developing a culturally relevant pedagogy; however, the authors acknowledge that most classrooms surveyed in the studies were culturally and racially homogeneous.  The teacher of a heterogeneous classroom may not find all such strategies useful.  The authors also expressed concerns over the observed challenges to schools, organizational structures, curriculum, and education, and called for changes in such spaces to permit more culturally relevant teaching.\n",
      "  Building a Framework for Classroom-Based Multicultural Democratic Education: Learning From Three Skilled Teachers. Marri (2005).\n",
      "  Marri’s primary research question investigates how three secondary social studies teachers “teach about and for multicultural democracy in their U.S. history courses”, and what factors “serve as obstacles in working toward classroom-based multicultural democracy” (p. 1037).  Marri’s framework is based on CMDE (classroom-based multicultural democratic education), the three parts of which are critical pedagogy, building a community, and thorough disciplinary content.  As part of their critical pedagogy and building a community, Marri observed the teachers reconceptualising the curriculum and building cooperative learning groups to model democracy; he also saw teachers providing students with “codes of power” in order to survive, then to challenge, expand, and change these codes.  Marri found that obstacles remained, some of them imposed by the teachers themselves through inadvertent privileging of diversity and using class homogeneity as an excuse.\n",
      "  Performing the Problematics and Possibilities of Developing a Curriculum for Cultural Diversity.  Carson, Johnston, Richardson, Mangat, Tupper, Wiltse, Mgombelo (2003).\n",
      "  This paper is (presumably) a transcript of a “performance” given at a 2003 conference.  Carson et al. discuss the tensions experienced by pre-service teachers between “multiculturalism as plan and multiculturalism as lived experience”, and while negotiating their personal and professional identities.  The centre of their discussion was a video (a “cultural artefact”) they produced intending to help educators “engage in empathetic inquiry into their own histories and cultural practices”; following this they described teacher perspectives around the video and implications thereof, particularly around that of whiteness and teaching.  Finally the researchers briefly examine observed tensions and resistances between ideology and engaged practice.\n",
      "  Questions\n",
      "“Learning to teach is a negotiatory process.  The way we imagine that we will teach as we are preparing to enter the classroom is not necessarily reflected in the way we actually teach.”  We talk about these survival shoes a lot in teacher education – how much of this is a copout?\n",
      "Is cultural difference, or a culturally relevant pedagogy, a mere matter of developing techniques and tools?\n",
      "What’s the difference between multicultural and anti-racist education?  Is there a difference?  Should there be a difference?\n",
      "Do you agree with Morrison et al. that heterogeneous classrooms inherently invite a different pedagogy than homogeneous classrooms?\n",

The findings are divided by the three main components of CRP according to Ladson Billings (High Expectations, Cultural Competence and Critical Consciousness). The authors draw from the research to explain how each of these goals is pursued by reporting on teachers’ actions in the classroom that illustrate this. They pose two questions in response to gaps in the research they reviewed. First, how do teachers operationalize CRP in classes that are heterogeneous (the great majority of research reviewed dealt with culturally and ethnically homogenous groups)? Second, how can CRP (which is necessarily disruptive of hegemony) be operationalized in educational environments that are organized in ways that perpetuate hegemony?\n",

The conversation attempts to investigate the spaces in between real and ideal, where it comes to practice and identity, to understand how teachers form ‘lived’, dynamic  curricula from formal plans and institutional demands. The discussion raises the question: ‘what is the relationship between ‘being’ and ‘doing’ in cultural diversity education?’ in relationship to the positionalities of student teachers. It uncovers some of the biases held by people learning to teach, as well as gaps in teacher education around diversity issues. The conversation concludes with the concept of the ‘undecidablility’ of teaching; a notion that troubles the search for ‘best practices’ and definitive answers to complex questions.\n",

A theoretical framework, called Classroom-based Multicultural Democratic Education (CMDE),  brings together “critical pedagogy, building of community, and thorough disciplinary content” and is put forward as a means of approaching quality multicultural democratic education. The article also discusses obstacles to successful CMDE, concluding that despite the seeming effectiveness of the teacher’s work, further studies are needed to examine the long-term impact of the work in engaging traditionally disengaged populations.\n",

According to Education Act Section 264(1) e: “It is the duty of the teacher and temporary teacher (e) to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline in the teacher’s classroom and while on duty in the school and on the school ground.”  Additionally, Education Act Section 265(1), Duties of Principal – discipline – a, - indicates that they are to “to maintain proper order and discipline in the school.”  Ontario Regulation 298, Duties of Principals 11(3)(e) goes on to say that they are to “provide for the supervision of pupils during the period of time during each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils” whereas the specific duties of teachers is laid out in Duties of Teachers – 20 – b - where it indicates teachers are to “carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require” and g, “ensure that all reasonable safety procedures are carried out in courses and activities for which the teacher is responsible.”  The school board policy issue would be specific to the particular board.  According to the Waterloo District School Board, for example, Administrative Procedure 1370 “Responsibility for Maintaining Safety, Security, and Order in the School Environment”\n",
      " (http://staff.wrdsb.ca/policyprocedure/files/2012/07/AP1370-Safe-Secure-Order-in-School1.pdf) clearly articulates the supervisory functions of principals and of teachers in the school environment.\n",
      "    2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens:\n",
      "  Different boards have varying policies but consistently they do have that is specifically addressing issues of diversity.  For instance, the Toronto District School Board has an Anti-Racism and Ethnocultural Equity Policy which states the following: ”The Board shall provide an appropriate mechanism to ensure accountability for achieving these goals by:\n",
      "….ensuring that educational practices are inclusive and reflect the contributions of diverse cultures, and that all forms of stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, racism, and violence against Aboriginal, racial, ethnocultural, and faith communities are challenged and eliminated.”  As this example policy indicates that the board SHALL provide an appropriate mechanism, it would depend slightly on what the board had actually determined to be that mechanism and where the accountability lay, whether at an administrative or a practitioner (ie, teacher) level.\n",
      "  3. A Professional Ethics Lens\n",
      "  According to the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT), the baseline ethical standards for the teaching profession are care, respect, trust and integrity.  Unfortunately, you can be acting in an ethical fashion while not necessarily adhering to the legal requirements.  In this particular case study, there was a difference between the ethics of care (ie, helping out students) versus meeting professional legal requirements for supervision.  While the teachers actions were not unethical, there was still an element of negligence.  As such, the question for teachers should not only be “am I acting in an ethical fashion?” but also where there are competing demands, “prior to meeting any additional commitments to students, have I carried out my baseline job requirements?”  Additionally, number 11 of OCT’s Misconduct Regulation states that “failing to supervise adequately a person who is under the professional supervision of the member” is an act of misconduct.\n",

Whether or not the seizer is legal, however, is a slightly different discussion.\n",
      "According to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Legal Rights – Search or seizure -  “everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.”  The key question then becomes whether or not the search was unreasonable.  Without a more thorough background in law, that determination is extremely difficult for at teacher to know.   Additional guidance can be found in the Ontario Ministry of Education Provincial Code of Conduct and School Board Codes of Conduct.  Specifically, they strongly discourage the use of alcohol and illegal drugs, both in Subsection 301 (2)  - #6, and in Standards of Behaviour – Safety, in which it states that “all members of the school community must not traffic weapons or illegal drugs; be in possession of, or be under the influence of, or provide others with alcohol or illegal drugs “ and finally in subsection Suspension “Possessing alcohol or illegal drugs”.\n",

All four are closely linked to this case study.  There is the very real possibility that there was no drug deal occurring, in which both perceived case and respect for the students could be compromised. Additionally, the question of what you are trying to accomplish by a drug raid must also be raised.  Although it is illegal in any given case, why are you honing in on these particular students?  Is there a reason which may compromise your perceived integrity, such as their identity as a particular marginalized group?  Additionally, consequences are never equal; some people are better equipped to deal with the legal and emotional ramifications of a drug ‘bust.’  In conducting such a raid, are you also prepared to provide the supports which would allow the raid to lead to ch6ange, or is it only likely to lead to arrest, cessation of schooling to that point, and disproportionate consequences later in life?

The teacher is responsible for all of the students under her supervision.  According to Education Act Section 264(1), Duties of Teacher - Care of pupils and property  “It is the duty of the teacher (j) to give assiduous attention to the health and comfort of the pupils.”  Additionally, Duties of Teachers 20 indicates that teachers will (b) “carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require” as well as (g) “ensure that all reasonable safety procedures are carried out in courses and activities for which the teacher is responsible.”   The question is not only did the teacher follow her responsibilities in the TRAUMA CARE of the injured students, but also whether she carried out her duties in the PREVENTION of harm.  Were there safety procedures in place which were ignored?  Additionally, the role of the principal is important, as according to Ontario Regulation 298, Duties of Principals 11(3)(e), the principal shall “ provide for the supervision of pupils during the period of time during each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils.” Both appear to have followed the letter of their duties but that does not ensure that there would be no cause to claim negligence.\n",

As such, there is an opportunity for conflict created that they otherwise would  not be exposed to.  In creating clear expectations around the supervision of students in that context, the possible conflicts which can arise by bringing together a diverse student population is minimized and the likelihood that they will have a safe learning environment is improved.\n",

Richardson describes how “each scene attempts to represent a different aspect of developing a curriculum for cultural diversity in teacher education curriculum”. Effectively, this text is a dialogue between teacher educators’ intentions and student teachers’ voices.  This “performance” juxtaposes theory and the dilemmas of culturally relevant teaching, as well as the difficulty of teaching teachers to teach something they don’t necessarily know how to engage with.

However, there is a certain level of discretion given to the principal as suspension is not MANDATED in this particular case.

There are significant potential lifelong consequences to 20 days of lost high school days of schooling which have a major academic impact which would ideally be avoided, particularly if the student was not strong academically and able to make up the time easily.  Such a consequences could reasonably be a factor in later drop out and lack of completion of high school, directly going against the mandate of the Ontario Ministry of Education.

What if she WAS lesbian, why would that be an insult?  Or is this about levering hate speech – in this case, homophobic - against someone he didn’t like?

Given that issue, a gay-straight alliance might be in a position to improve understandings of sexual orientation, particular as it pertains to constructed gendered identities as being separate from sexual preference.

      "            Student teachers, as well as their students, must be given the opportunity to question their own cultural identities, even if those identities may be likened to association by non-association, or by “whiteness”.  Cultural diversity is normally equated to a minority trait, and this prolongs the norm where everything else other than the mainstream is considered multicultural.  This enforces some student teachers’ ideas around cultural difference as being: the externalized other, as a pedagogical technique, or as a threatening presence.\n",
      "            Cultural differences should be understood as lived experiences, as everyone speaks from a cultural location.  We are primed to believe that the idea of “whiteness”, which is present in the “hidden” curriculum, addresses the mainstream lived experiences, and that anything else is just multicultural.  This marginalizes the “other”.  It denies their existence in the mainstream, and prolongs the stereotyping of them as “other”, and not part of the whole.  This is only possible by watering down the conception of “whiteness”, and making it culturally indistinguishable, to the point where it cannot be explained.  It is bound to the unconscious mind.  It, then, can only be defined in relation to the “other”.  Curriculum reinforces this idea.\n",

The current traditional structure of schooling favours transmission of knowledge to suit standardized testing and curriculum expectations.  This leads to a more teacher-directed approach, as oppose to a student-centered one, which contradicts good culturally relevant pedagogy.  More time is required to do it right, and in order to hit all the dimensions of such a pedagogy, teachers need more time and resources to get to know the students, their families, and their communities, and how their needs can be best met.\n",
      "            If we are to give students the equitable education they deserve, teachers must allow students involvement in the curriculum in order to engage them in their own schooling.  Culturally relevant pedagogy, in its multiple dimensions, is part of the solution.\n",

This should create a healthy amount of confusion.\n",

      "·         The next step is to have students think about how measuring systems are devised. Ask students “If you were to create your own measurement system, what would it be based on?”. Think, pair, share for 5 minutes or less.\n",
      "·         At this stage, students should read the parts of the book dedicated to the Egyptian system and the imperial system. Students should not read the part of the book about the metric system, as it is beneficial that the teacher be the one to teach it with the assistance of the book.\n",
      "·         Ask students at what temperature water boils and at what temperature it freezes. Explain that 0 degrees and 100 degrees are very round numbers, and very convenient. Explain that the Celcius system of measuring temperatures was just fixed to those numbers. Before that, temperature was measured in other ways.\n",

      "·         Discuss with elbow partners why we have chosen water to be the base of our measurement systems. (To guide students, the instructor may want to say: “I don’t think forearms are a good measure.” and line up their forearm with a student’s. “Why doesn’t that work well?”\n",

I'm sure school culture has something to do with it too, but on the Friday observation day, after my AT and I taught them how to add fractions with different denominators, they were somehow really excited about math and even stayed behind during recess to teach each other in front of the SMARTboard, no joke.\n",

      "8,1039,2,1. A Legal Lens: What do the statutes, regulations, memoranda and school district policies say on this case?\n",
      "              Based on the statues, regulations, memoranda, and school district policies, it is clear that both the teacher and the principal did not fulfill their duties. According to the Education Act, it states under section 264(e) that one of the duties of a teacher is \"to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline in the teacher’s classroom and while on duty in the school and on the school ground\". Furthermore, regulation 298 (20) states that one of the duties of a teacher is to \"carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require\". In order for the teacher to maintain such discipline and provide information to the principal, the teacher must follow the duty schedule. Although the teacher is helping students inside the classroom, the teacher is obligated to supervise the cafeteria as the duty schedule had stated. Unless the principal gave clear instructions to the teacher to help students after class, the teacher would be obliged by law to fulfill the supervisory duties as teacher. Also, the teacher would not be able to report to the principal as he/she was not performing his/her duty.\n",
      "            The principal would also be held accountable for the teacher being late for his/her supervisory duty as the education act section 265 states that the principal is responsible \"to maintain proper order and discipline in the school\". Also, regulation 298 (11) states that it is the principal's responsibility to \"provide for the supervision of pupils during the period of time during each school day when the school buildings and playgrounds are open to pupils\". Therefore, by not having the teacher in his supervisory role, the principal failed to meet the duties and responsibilities of a principal. Both the teacher and principal would be accountable for this incident according to these legal acts.\n",
      "  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: If the incident was initiated by a racist comment or act what responsibilities would a school board take into consideration?\n",
      "              A school board would want to know about which student said the racist comment and why the comment was said. School boards have policies for equity and social justice issues. For example, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has the Anti-Racism and Ethnocultural equity policy that requires all schools have \"educational practices [that] are inclusive and reflect the contributions of diverse cultures, and that all forms of stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, racism, and violence against Aboriginal, racial, ethnocultural, and faith communities are challenged and eliminated\". A school board would thus want to talk to both the principal and the supervisory teacher to gain insight about the incident and how such comments can be abolished.  However, with the teacher not being present in the cafeteria compounds the issue. The school board would have a difficult time eliminating such comments if teachers are not fulfilling their supervisory duties and stopping the fight before it escalated. One of the rights that a principal has, according to Ontario Regulation 298, is to recommend to a school board whether to demote or dismiss the teacher. If the principal goes to a school board and explains to them about the incident and requests that the teacher was not on duty as instructed, the school board would likely dismiss the teacher due to the teacher not meeting any equity policies.\n",
      "            3. A Professional Ethics Lens: As a member of the College of Teachers you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, explore the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards.\n",
      "                 According the Ontario College of Teachers, this teacher demonstrated professional misconduct by \"failing to supervise adequately a person who is under the professional supervision of the member\". This neglect of his/her duties resulted in two students getting into a fight and serious injuries to the student body. By not fulfilling ones duty of supervising the students, the teacher does not demonstrate the ethical standard of care. To care is to ensure the well-being of students and in this case, the teacher could not ensure the students well being when he/she failed to perform his/her duty (and in this case did not do so as there were injuries). These injuries could have been prevented if the teacher was their during ones duty. If the incident was caused by a racist remark, the teacher would also not meet the ethical standard of respect due to not modelling social justice and the emotional wellness of students. This incident could (and will) lead to lack of trust and integrity among other teachers, the principal, and most importantly the students. Also, this teacher must also oblige the standards and practices of the teaching profession. This incident shows that the teacher is not committed to students as he/she did not perform his/her duty. Lastly, the teacher needed to demonstrate that he/she is a leader in the school and professional knowledge. By not performing one's duty failed to show commitment to the needs of the students and demonstrated poor leadership.,\n",
      "8,1041,1,1. A Legal Lens: What do the statutes, regulations, memoranda and school district policies say on this case?\n",
      "  In this particular case, the teacher observing these two students is acting appropriately. Based on the Education Act Regulation 298 (20), teachers are responsible to \"carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require\". Therefore, telling the vice-principal about what the teacher saw was required and ethical. In terms of the search, according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms section 8, \"everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure\" and the students could argue that their rights are being violated. However, the vice-principal feels that she has a reasonable cause for conducting a search of the student. Based on the Provincial Code of Conduct and the School Board Codes of Conduct, both teachers and principals are responsible by law \"to ensure the safety of the student body\"; which includes that they are responsible for not promoting the trafficking and use of illegal drugs. Therefore, principals can (if they so choose) call the police and determine whether this exchange warrants a criminal investigation. Furthermore, principals have the right to considering suspending the student if they believe they are committing a crime and are allowed to investigate the matter further.\n",
      "  2. A Professional Ethics Lens: As a member of the College of Teachers you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, explore the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards.\n",
      "  As a member of the Ontario College of Teachers, teachers are to ensure that the ethical standards of care, respect, trust, and integrity are met. Although I do believe that the vice-principal is right, I think that the vice-principal could have first asked the students about the exchange first before searching the students. By asking the student first, the vice-principal and teacher would be ensuring the trust of all members of the school community (i.e. parents/guardians wondering why was a search conducted?). Although the vice-principal and teacher are trying to meet the four ethical standards (as they want all students to safe and are doing what they feel is best for them), I feel that being honest and fair-minded is also important as well. By simply asking the student first about whether or not there had been a drug exchange, the vice-principal and teacher are showing openness and honestly. While I do not disagree with the search as they feel that there is a reasonable cause, being open about ones intention is just as important.\n",
      "As a teacher who must follow the standards and practices of the teaching profession, each teacher must show professional practice and knowledge. In this case, both vice-principal and teacher are demonstrating professional knowledge as they are using legislation to guide their reasons for a search. However, professional practice means that one must use appropriate methods when demonstrating professionalism (which includes responding to the needs of school community). Therefore, perhaps asking the student before the search would have been better practice. This could be done upon further reflection (a practice that all teachers must do).,\n",
      "8,1043,1,1. A Legal Lens: What do the statutes, regulations, memoranda and school district policies say on this case?\n",
      "  According to the Education Act section 265, the principal is responsible \"for maintaining proper order and discipline of the entire school\" along with the attentive health of all students. Since it is the teachers responsibility, according to section 264 of the education act, \"to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline while on duty on school grounds\", the teacher is also responsible for the health and safety of these students. Furthermore, the Ontario Regulation 298 states \"that teachers are responsible to ensure that all safety procedures are enforced both inside and outside of the classroom\". In this case, this activity was clearly unsafe due to the activity itself. If the students were \"vigorously\" playing foot hockey, they are likely to be extremely competitive. This competitiveness resulted in two students banging in to each other. This activity was also unsafe since they were playing on asphalt. Asphalt is a very hard surface and could cause serious injury if a student were to fall. This case study clearly shows that the student crashed into the asphalt wall resulting in an injury. With the activity being extremely energetic and surface area being unsafe itself, the teacher should not have allowed these grade 3 year olds to play foot hockey. The teacher was undoubtedly not playing attention and is responsible for their injuries.\n",
      "  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: In your view, why is it important for students that administrators and teachers abide by Ontario Regulation 298, 11(3)(e)?\n",
      "  Teachers should follow this regulation because it is their responsibility to act \"in loco parentis\". This means that teachers are supposed to treat each student as if they were our child. It is the teacher's duty to protect every student in our care and students should feel safe and secure when they leave their parents/guardians and come into the school. When a parent sends their child to school, they expect that the child will be returned to them safely (both physically and emotionally). When students are playing outside during recess and lunch, there is a chance that students will become injured or hurt. Therefore, it is the teachers responsibility to actively watch over students so they will return to their parents/guardians in the same condition as they left them.\n",
      "  3. A Professional Ethics Lens: As a member of the College of Teachers you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, explore the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards.\n",
      "  After viewing this case, it is clear that this teacher did not show the ethical standard of care and trust while on duty. Care is shown by teachers when the teacher demonstrates interest in the student's well-being and if a teacher does not realize the potential danger of an activity and watches a student injure him/herself, then it is clear that the teacher has broken this ethical standard. Furthermore, the teacher broke the ethical standard of trust since the principal may feel that the teacher is not responsible enough to carry one's duty. Also, the students may feel unsafe around the teacher. Lastly, the parents of that student (and other students) will feel uneasy sending their children to school if that teacher is on duty.\n",
      "In terms of the Standards and Practices for the teaching profession, this teacher does not promote the commitment to students and student learning as well as professional practice as the teacher did not pay attention to the students. A teacher when on duty must be aware at all times with what the student is doing. By observing the students playing foot hockey on asphalt, the teacher used professional judgment that this activity was safe. However, the end result proves otherwise. This injury could have been prevented if the teacher had spoken to them about being safe. Thus the teacher did not show commitment to students and to one's own professional practice.,\n",

      "8,1045,1,In your opinion, why does Joe Jamieson and the Ontario College of Teachers recommend that teachers not communicate with students by e-mail? Similarly, why would they discourage teachers from \"friending\" a student on Facebook or express concerns about a teacher privately \"tweeting\" a student on Twitter?\n",
      "  The Ontario College of Teachers indicates that although teachers have private lives, the teaching profession is one of public knowledge. Using social media and emails are public tools that although provide various benefits, there is potential harm for both the teacher and the student. Joe Jamison believes that it is important that teachers act in a professional manner and students need to see teachers as professionals and not as friends. He thus argues that email has the potential to close the gap between the teacher/student professional relationship (and thus the private and professional life of the teacher). Jamison states teachers that email their students are more likely to be treated differently, and in some cases in an unprofessional manner. Through the constant interaction of emailing between teacher and student, the lines of professionalism can be crossed (students addressing teachers by their first name) and eventually the teacher will lose the students respect. This not only applies to emails but to other social media websites as well (Facebook, Twitter). To \"friend\" a student on Facebook or send a private tweet bridges the gap between student and teacher and professionalism gets blurred. In no way do teachers want students to lose respect of them, and as Jameson states \"students do not respect teachers that are their friend, but rather their teacher\". Once the teacher/student professional relationship has been crossed, there is a greater chance that the teacher perform an act that is of professional misconduct.\n",
      "            For example, one act that the Ontario College of Teachers considers to be deemed professional misconduct is \"releasing or disclosing information about a student to a person other than the student or, if the student is a minor, the student’s parent or guardian\". Social media has the potential for students information to get leaked out or other potential dangerous information. The harm that could be done to students is amplified since using social media to communicate information becomes public knowledge even if the information is tended to be private. Information that get posted on these social media sources will be their forever and the harmful effects that it could have on students is limitless.\n",
      "            These are the reasons that Jamison feels that teachers not communicate through email and potentially other social media sources.,\n",
      "8,1046,1,1. A Legal Lens: What are the facts in this case and what is the main legal issue in this matter?\n",
      "                 According the Criminal Code section 319, it states that it is a criminal act to publically promote the hatred of a specific group of people to students and such an act could result in imprisonment. Furthermore, the Provincial Code of Conduct states that teachers must not \"engage in hate propaganda and other forms of behaviour motivated by hate or bias\". In this case, James Keegstra was promoting the hatred of Jewish people to his students. Keegstra argued that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects his rights. Section 1 and 2 of the Charter does state that he has the right to free speech, and has the right to express his thoughts, beliefs, and opinions. Furthermore, the charter does state that these rights will be protected as long as it is deemed \"reasonable in a democratic society\". However, section 27 of the charter states that \"This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians\". Therefore, while Keegstra does have freedom of speech, he does not promote the Jewish culture in a positive light.\n",
      "    2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: Describe the \"tension\" between the nature and limitations upon on individual's Charter rights (i.e., the teacher's academic freedom to certain expression of views) and the impact that these expressed views may have on students and society.\n",
      "                           Based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, James Keegstra felt that he had the right to promote hate propaganda to his students and thus make his views public knowledge. According to the Ontario Human Rights Code \"Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, family status or handicap\" Since classrooms are diverse in nature (students have a wide array of cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds) there were students in Keegstra's classroom could have been of Jewish descent and would thus be discriminated against. Furthermore, Keegstra does promote discrimination as (according to the Canadian human rights act) \"it is a discriminatory practice to publish or display before the public or to cause to be published or displayed before the public any notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation\" Keegstra actively and publically promotes that Jewish people should be treated differently and his students must accept his views. By forcing his students to accept his views, he is in itself denying students right to free speech and to openly object to his claims.\n",
      "            On society as a whole, there could be even further division based on his opinion. Society itself may feel that Keegstra has the right to his opinions even if people believe that he is wrong with his beliefs. Others on the other hand may feel that students are impressionable and he is infecting the youth with hate propaganda and racism and thus should not be allowed to teach. Although society would generally view Keegstras opinions as wrong, society itself would have mixed opinions over whether or not Keegstra should be fired for expressing his opinions. Freedom of speech and expression are important in this country but the society would struggle with where to draw the line with academic freedom and hate propaganda.\n",
      "    3.A Professional Ethics Lens: What professional ethics issues reside at the heart of this case?\n",
      "                 The main ethical issues of \"care\" and \"respect\" are at the heart of this case. To care means that teachers must show compassion, acceptance, interest and insight for developing students'. Furthermore, teachers are committed to students' well-being and learning through positive influence, professional judgment and empathy in practice. Not only did Keegstra not show any of these traits, but hurt students using hate propaganda. To promote the hatred of a specific race or ethnicity is not compassionate and it illustrates that this teacher is not accepting of other people. Furthermore, hate propaganda is a negative influence of students and would affect their well being. Keegstra also does not show respect as he does not encourage spiritual and cultural values, social justice, confidentiality, freedom, democracy and the environment. He opposes them. Furthermore Keegstra has demonstrated that he not dedicated to student learning, does not demonstrate appropriate professional knowledge/practice, or leadership. To engage in professional practice in particular is to be reflecting in one's own teaching. Even with possible backlash and being told that his views are wrong, he still engaged in his own hate propaganda and will not be told that his views are incorrect. His teaching is not of proper ethical standard and he should thus be barred from teaching.,\n",

      "a) It is clear that cyber-bullying has occurred in this case. According to provincial laws and regulations, what is Ms. Marks obliged to do after overhearing Kayla’s and Ally’s conversation and being shown the contents Jay’s Facebook site\n",
      "              Ms. Marks is obliged to go directly to the principal regarding this matter. The education act section 300.2 states that \"an employee of a board who becomes aware that a pupil of a school of the board may have engaged in an activity described in subsection 306 (1) or 310 (1) \"shall report to the principal of the school about the matter\".  Subsection 306 of the education act lists bullying as grounds for suspension, and cyberbullying is an act of bullying. According to Bill 13, bullying is defined by as behavior designed to cause an individual bodily or mental harm or create a negative setting. In this case, Sally was being bullied as she no longer felt safe to attend school. Since Ms. Marks is now aware that bullying has occurred, she must report to the principal immediately or by the end of the school day. After the verbal report, a written report must be written if it is safe to do so.\n",
      "    b) According to provincial laws and regulations, what steps should be taken by the school regarding Kayla’s, Ally’s and Jay’s actions?\n",
      "                      Since bullying falls under section 306 of the education act, both the education act and bill 212 state that the principal should consider to suspend these students. The principal must therefore look at mitigating factors. These factors are:\n",
      "  \"a) the pupil does not have the ability to control his or her behaviour\n",
      "b) the pupil does not have the ability to understand the foreseeable consequences of his or her behaviour\n",
      "c) the pupil's continuing presence in the school does not create an unacceptable risk to the safety of any person\".\n",
      "            After looking at the mitigating factors, the principal should then decide whether or not to suspend the students.\n",
      "    c) What steps should be taken by the school with reference to Sandy, the victim in this scenario?\n",
      "               Based on policy 144 - Bullying and Prevention and intervention, once the school is aware that the student Sandy is the subject of bullying, the teacher and principal need to inform her parents/guardians (unless she is 18 or 16-17 and is not under parental control). Furthermore, the school (and school boards) should implement intervention and support strategies to help Sandy. Teachers also need to be properly trained to help students (like Sandy) cope with bullying.\n",
      "    d) What is the teacher’s role concerning students’ use of technology outside of the school?\n",
      "              According to the York Region Appropriate Use of Technology document, teachers are responsible for the overall management of student use of computing and information technology facilities and resources within their assigned teaching areas or when acting in a supervisory role; and instructing and modeling for students the appropriate use of technology. This means that teachers are to set the appropriate example for what is and is not appropriate use of technology. Since teachers are thus responsible to make sure that students are using technology safely they must enforce safety rules like: revealing your personal identity, giving out your password, using inappropriate websites (Facebook, Twitter), never sending pictures of oneself to other people.\n",

      "\n",
      "a) Changes to the Education Act encourage the promotion of a positive school climate including activities that promote gender equity. How would a positive proactive response to this incident promote gender equity?\n",
      "    Since the case study clearly indicates that bullying has occurred, an incident like this must be reported to the principal as stated in section 306 of the education act. Although, the principal has the right and authority under the education act to suspend these students, other actions can be taken to help promote gender equality. Section 303.1 states that “every board shall support pupils who want to establish and lead activities and organizations that promote a safe and inclusive learning environment, the acceptance of and respect for others and the creation of a positive school climate, including, (a) activities or organizations that promote gender equity”. Therefore, the principal and teachers have Kayla, Sandy, Ally and Jay start an organization that raises awareness of bullying and cyberbullying. Each student could share their experiences about how the incident affected them. Having Jay and the female students talk about their experiences could also raise gender equity issues, such as how female/male students are treated. Also, these students could also talk about not just the incident but of bullying in general.\n",
      "    3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\n",
      "  a) With all these changes to safe schools legislation what can teachers expect in the way of professional development support when it comes to the issue of bully?\n",
      "        According to the Education act section 170 (7.1), it is expected that these professional development programs “establish and provide annual professional development programs to educate teachers and other staff of the board about bullying prevention and strategies for promoting positive school climates”. These bullying prevention programs should encourage teachers to follow the ethical standards of the teaching profession so teachers can better be able to deal with students who are victims of bullying. The programs should help teachers become more caring about the emotional well-being of students along with teaching teachers how to promote acceptance and compassion to those who are being bullied. Also, these programs should also provide support to teachers to help talk to parents of children that are both being bullied and are the bully.\n",
      "    b) As a member of the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) you are governed by the standards of the teaching profession. In viewing this case, what are the implications for the standards of practice and ethical standards? How would these standards support preventative measures?\n",
      "              In order to prevent cases of bullying, students need to be able to speak to the teacher about these issues. The mistake in this case study was that Sandy did not talk to her teacher. This mistake led to this hijacking scenario to get out of control, to the point where Sandy is no longer safe in school. In order for Sandy to feel secure, the teacher needed to show the ethical standards of care, trust, respect, and integrity. If a student can confide in a teacher and feel comfortable talking about incidents of bullying, then a teacher can do whatever means necessary to prevent it from going further. A student needs to feel that a teacher is accepting of the student, regardless of any mistakes on made. This also demonstrates that the student respects the teacher as well. As a teacher, however, needs to show integrity and be honest with the student about what he/she will do with this knowledge.,\n",
      "8,1049,1,1. A Legal Lens:\n",
      "a) What is an appropriate disciplinary course of action for the male student who made the slur?\n",
      "                 A suspension or expulsion would be appropriate for this male student. Under section 310 of the education act, \"A principal shall suspend a pupil if he or she believes that the pupil has engaged in.....any activity listed in subsection 306 (1) that is motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or any other similar factor\". This student was not only bullying Tricia (which is subsection 306 of the education act), but, the remark was motivated from Tricia's outward appearance and addressed her sexual orientation.\n",
      "  b) Should Tricia, the girl who instigated the shoving match in response to the slur, be disciplined differently than the student who made the slur? What mitigating factors might the principal consider?\n",
      "              Tricia should be treated differently and not be suspended. According to Regulation 472 a mitigating factor that the principal should consider is \"whether the activity for which the pupil may be or is being suspended or expelled was related to any harassment of the pupil because of his or her race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation or to any other harassment\". In this instance, Tricia was the subject to discrimination due to her gender and sexual orientation.\n",
      "  2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: In the past few years changes to the Education Act, as well as educational policies and regulations, have been designed to counter some of the flaws in previously existing \"zero-tolerance\" styled laws. Researchers have found that zero-tolerance educational laws have had disproportionate and negative effects on groups such as, adolescent males, different language groups, racial minorities, those designated for special education, or those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.**\n",
      "  a) As a beginning teacher how you would address the incident with the victim? With the rest of the team? With the student who made the slur?\n",
      "              In terms of the student, I would make the student more proactive in the cause for gender equity and rights. 303.1 of the education act states that \"every board shall support pupils who want to establish and lead activities and organizations that promote a safe and inclusive learning environment, the acceptance of and respect for others and the creation of a positive school climate\". In this case, I would want Tricia to create an organization that promotes the awareness of gender equity and people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, including organizations with the name gay-straight alliance or another name. With the rest of the team, I think it's important to ensure the team that Tricia should be treated equitably and with the same amount of respect that you would have given to her previously. The team should be aware that Tricia took offense to the student that made the slur. It's important to make sure the team supports Tricia and they should stand by her both as a teammate and as her friend. To the student that made the slur I would explain to the student that it was completely unacceptable for him to use that slur. It was wrong to use any racist or homosexual remarks, that what the student did ruined the event and that he that there will be consequences for his slur and his actions. Even though he did not start the fight it with his words that enticed it and it led to someone being hurt. This student will be sent to the principal's office and the student should be told that he could be suspended or even expelled for his actions. However the student should also be told that he could be given a second chance if he's willing to learn why what he said was incredibly offensive (i.e. attend gay awareness seminars).\n",
      "  3. A Professional Ethics Lens:\n",
      "In light of the incident, how might a gay/straight alliance club promote a deeper understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation\n",
      "                 I think that a gay/straight alliance club could promote student growth and well-being, acceptance among all students, and compassion from both the student body and the school community. A club that addresses gender identity and sexual orientation issues would draw all different members of the student body. First, students that are gay would be open to join as it provides a safe environment for these students to openly talk about homosexual issues. Also, allowing straight students to join provides an opportunity for learning about homosexual issues. By making this alliance a safe and secure place allows for thoughts, feelings, and experiences to be talked about and explored. School communities would want a club like this because it also raises awareness of about gay/straight issues. A gay/straight club would make students more educated about these issues and could help prevent incidents (like the slur against Tricia) from ever happening.,\n",
      "8,1050,2,As a teacher, this to me indicates that Mr. Jones is sexually abusing one of his students because sexual abuse is defined as inappropriate touching of a student. The teacher openly lied to me about the performance, the teacher was alone with a student, the room was in darkness, and his arm is around the shoulder of his grade 3 student (the latter of which is sexual abuse). This type of action is grounds for professional misconduct and thus it is my duty based on the teacher education act, and the child services act to report Mr Jones to my principal and any other legal authority. Even if Mr. Jones were to claim that he is not sexually abusing his students, I would still have to report him because of my suspicion, otherwise I would be in violation of professional misconduct.,\n",
      "8,1051,1,As a teacher it is important that I would never be alone with a student at all times and write what a student says to me. In Mr. Safah's example, the student made a threat to the teacher. In order to clear his name, he had written down what was said to him and had other students sign the statement. This was used as evidence that no sexual abuse/assault took place. Therefore, I would write anything down that was said to me by my students. Furthermore, what I could do to protect myself is make sure that doors are open at all times so I can be visible as possible. Lastly, I would make sure that I would not do anything to further cross the line between teacher and student relationship (not give out personal information, not use email as contact).,\n",
      "8,1052,1,As a teacher, I must follow the child and services act. According to section 72, “if a person, including a person who performs professional or official duties with respect to children, has reasonable grounds to suspect one of the following, the person shall forthwith report the suspicion and the information on which it is based to a society”. One of “the following” that this section discusses is that the person (or child) “has suffered physical harm inflicted by someone in charge of one’s care”. In this case, the teacher suspects that Michael’s father has struck his son. Furthermore, section 79 of this act states that child abuse is considered an offensive as it defines physical harm as one of its characteristics. Therefore, the teacher must report this to the principal.,\n",

      "8,1056,1,I really like Jump Math.\n",
      "I first got introduced to it in my second placement and I thought it was great. I especially liked how everything was extremely scaffolded.  I am pretty sure that I read JUMP math is created similar to DI (direct instruction) programs in the sense that students only will learn 5-10% more each lesson. For anxious, struggling students, this is good because there is a lot of room for review, and the next lessons are not overwhelming.\n",
      "Also, as a teacher it was easy to see where the student was struggling. If they are struggling with 'fractions' you could go back to see which particular part of fractions they are struggling with because it was so broken down. Sometimes in student centred or inquiry it is hard to see which part of the concept was confusing for the student.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I liked JUMP math because I don't think it is just 'skills and drills.' They refered to it as \"guided discovery.\" The students, and myself, were still learning WHY things were the way they were. I never learned this in school, and jump math made it very clear. The teacher still had to ask questions to the student to help them figure out reasons why the math was working.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, I liked the scripted lessons in JUMP. I think this is good for consistency of language. I find, and I'm sure some students find, math language can be confusing. By using a scripted lesson (similar to DI approach), it ensures certain terms are not thrown around or that the teacher jumps back n forth between terms that might throw the student off. I think the consistency is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, though, I can see why some do not like JUMP math. There are not a lot of communication questions, and I don't think there are too many aplication concepts.

TBH I can't really imagine math concepts NOT being scaffolded that way...\n",
      "  re: I think, however, that teachers can teach the concepts through JUMPif they wish, but add their own application questions to the program while still following the program - (maybe?)\n",
      "  That's pretty much how I've been teaching math for the past several years (not with JUMP, but with a lot of scaffolding, which I'd argue is just as important for strong math students as math-anxious as it encourages students to reason their way through their decision-making, which in turn promotes deep understanding through practice). I seldom have time to address questions of social justice in the classroom (whatever that looks like), but as Nikki mentioned in class today, I believe the solid math grounding itself will enable students to be more critical of the world around them. If taught right (?), the students should be able to apply their knowledge to new/complex situations too. That's pretty much my philosophy to math instruction. I (feel that I have to) have faith that if they are to learn about social issues in science, they will do so mostly in science class. If they learn about social issues in history, they will do so mostly in history class. Realistically, I don't see non-math teachers integrating math concepts seriously/deeply into their classes, so I consider my primary role to be in providing students with a mathematical skill set. Conversely, I wouldn't want my math class to turn into the \"everything-but-math class\".\n",
      "  That isn't to say I don't believe in cross-curricular integration; just that I'm reluctant to teach in way that math becomes demoted to a supporting role. e.g. are we using math as a piece of evidence to explain the seriousness of racial profiling in law enforcement? Or are we using racial profiling as an example to teach how ratios/percentages can be meaningful in real world contexts? I think it's worth thinking about the distinction between the two as a starting point to inform our approach to cross-curricular integration (and social justice, environmental stewardship, technology, etc.) If it's the former, I'd much rather collaborate with a social studies teacher and tell him/her that I'm teaching the students about ratios in my math class, and request that ratios be mentioned in passing in social studies class. Maybe it's the purist in me, but sometimes I feel that too much integration can be parasitic rather than symbiotic (ecology terms w00t).\n",

      "8,1063,1,Electronic communication is extraordinarily delicate because it both lacks the additional ability to distinguish “tone” as well as has the ability to be easily captured as a permanent record.  Tweets, social media messages, email, texts, etc, all fall under that chapeau.  Given the extraordinary high ability to be misunderstood or misconstrued, combined with the ability to be saved for future reference, it is extremely unwise for educators in a position of authority to communicate with their students in anything other than an extremely public fashion.  Additionally, adults as well as children increasingly have a digital identity as individuals.  For adults, that identity can be comprehensive and quite personal, having begun when younger and comprising numerous forums such as hobbies, professional interests, personal relationships, etc.  Inviting a student to participate with that online, comprehensive identity is a boundary violation which would be much clearer if done in person – ie, invited into the home or out on a weekend – but is somehow not always understood as the boundary crossing that it is.  “Friending” a student implies exactly that – inviting a student into your life as a peer.  For a teacher, that is clear misconduct and inappropriate.,\n",

Essentially, the main legal issue did not centre around “who did what to whom” but rather, whether those facts constituted a violation of section 319 of the criminal code, which indicates everyone who incites hatred against any identifiable group through statements in public place, where such is likely to lead to a breach of the peace, is guilty of an offense.  In the end, 3 of the 7 judges felt that Keegstra was not guilty, despite his obvious role of authority in a public space.  That is as important to remember as the 4 who ruled him guilty.\n",

According to the Child and Family Services Act: “Anyone who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is or may be in need of protection must promptly report the suspicion and the information upon which it is based to a CAS.” I would report the situation directly to Children’s Aid Society and trust that that they have their own process.  To support any further investigation, I would write out the detailed report with as much information as possible as soon as possible (exact location, those present – Mr Jones, the student, myself – date, time of day, etc).  In addition to reporting to CAS, I would let my principal know immediately, and clarify the process for reporting based on the specific board policies in place (presumably consistent with the overarching legal framework).

Where did the scuffle take place? What was it about?  What object was responsible for the cut?  Perhaps catching the brother and posing similar questions.  If their stories completely corroborate, there is minimal cause for suspicion.  If they do not, then a report to CAS is obligatory.  Additionally, the OCT includes ‘care’ in its professional standards.  ‘Care’ would indicate care that the student is being harmed physically, whether or not that is coming from an adult.

      "  Of course a teacher CAN refuse; however, it’s doubtful that teacher will be teaching anything after that refusal.\n",
      "  2. If a teacher is a witness to a serious incident on school property what is his/her responsibility regarding the investigation of the incident?\n",
      "  According to Education Act Section 264(1) e: “It is the duty of the teacher and temporary teacher (e) to maintain, under the direction of the principal, proper order and discipline in the teacher’s classroom and while on duty in the school and on the school ground.”  Further, Duties of Teachers – 20 – b - it indicates teachers are to “carry out the supervisory duties and instructional program assigned to the teacher by the principal and supply such information related thereto as the principal may require.”\n",
      "    3. If I have a student in my class who has been identified as anaphylactic with an allergy to peanuts, what is my responsibility?\n",
      "  There are a series of issues under Ontario legislation “Sabrina’s Law” (2005). These include both preventative and reactive responsibilities for students.  For instance, schools are now nut-free.  Additionally, teachers have the ability to administer epi-pens for students with allergies.  However, first aid treatments and laws change; therefore, it is the responsibility of the teacher to be familiar with the current laws and recommended procedures for those with allergies.  There are several frequently asked questions available online: http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/healthyschools/bill3qanda.html  Additionally, the situation in a rural school far from hospitals is significantly different than urban centres; responsibilities reflect the reality of access to care and teachers should be aware of their own reality.\n",
      "  4. I observe two students talking on the playground and watch as a slim shiny object is passed from one student to the other. The receiving student bends down and places the item in his sock. What should my actions be?\n",
      "  As the teacher is the authority under the direction of the principal, the most logical step would be to bring them to the principal to investigate more thoroughly.  The desire to conceal the object in the sock is sufficiently covert that further questioning is warranted, particularly as it may be a weapon and endanger other students.\n",
      "    5. Can a teacher reproduce a whole literary work and distribute it to the students in his/her class?\n",

      "  Professional ethics indicate that “care” is part of the equation.  The mental health of students is extremely important, as are possible signs of abuse (ie, depression; substance use leading to lethargy; exploitation through child labour).  However, depending on the age/charactheristics of the child it may simply be too many extracurricular and a joy of reading keeping him/her awake into the night.  Questioning to get a sense of which of the many possibilities is at work is a first step beyond making any rash judgement calls.\n",
      "    2. What are my protections if a student makes a false accusation of sexual misconduct on my part?\n",
      "  There is a difference between sexual misconduct and criminal charges.  The former is one of professional misconduct; as a member of the Federation, I would have recourse to their supports.   If it were the latter, legal supports would be in order and it would depend on various board policies.\n",
      "    3. I receive a call from a parent of one of my students stating that they would like a report on their child's academic progress. I am aware that there has been a recent change in marital status of the parents and am unsure of whether I should provide this information.\n",
      "  There is a delicate balance between respecting the law and actively investigating a custody situation.  I would confirm that the office has not been officially informed of a change in custody with corresponding directions on how to disclose information; however, if there has been no official directive, it is not the prerogative of a teacher to withhold information on a child from a parent.\n",

Jamieson also makes the point that it’s easy for students to attain a record of correspondence which may latter be interpreted as inappropriate, especially when out of context. Communicating with students on Facebook and Twitter is similarly risky for the same reasons; and especially because many students associate social media with a way to communicate with their peers, room for boundary-confusion is even more present.,\n",

The incident should be seen to have a negative impact on school climate, and therefore must be reported and addressed. At that point, it would be up to the principal to decide whether or not to give a suspension to the students involved in the bullying, or whether to take other action.  The principal would also be responsible for notifying the parents of the victim, unless he or she believes that doing so would put the student at further risk. In the case that the parents were not notified, the principal must make sure accommodations are made for the student’s care.\n",

      "The student may be suspended, by the principal, for up to 20 school days. I think that, in this case, suspension may or may not be warranted, depending on other circumstantial or mitigating factors. A lot of time would need to be spent understanding the relationship between the two students, as well as history of behaviours of both students. Though this may be an unlikely situation, it could be that the students has Tourettes Syndrome, and exhibits coprolalia as a symptom. It could be that the student, as well as Tricia, has shown difficulty in the past understanding the consequences of their actions. In some cases, suspension may not be the most effective way of ensuring this kind of behaviour isn’t repeated, but in some cases it may.\n",
      "    2. An Equity, Diversity, and Social Justice Lens: I would start by asking the victim how they felt about the situation and why they reacted the way they did. I would explain that what the other student did was unacceptable, and try to help her understand why sometimes people say things with the intention to hurt others, and explain what kind of consequences have ensued for the boy who shouted the slur. There definitely needs to be a discussion around homophobia and how the student can deal with instances like this in the future without getting physical. This is a job that needs to be done with the team, as well as the girl. The student who made the slur needs all this as well, but also needs to be helped to see why his comment was hurtful, and that comments like that cannot be made under any circumstances. There have to be consequences that would be determined with mitigating factors being taken into account. As a beginning teacher, I would definitely consult the school administration as to how to proceed.\n",

The child has been sexually molested or sexually exploited (suspected to have been), by the person having charge of the child or by another person where the person having charge of the child knows or should know of the possibility of sexual molestation or sexual exploitation and fails to protect the child.’ It’s important to note that, according to the Teaching Profession Act, any teacher who makes an adverse report about the suspicion of sexual abuse in regards to another teacher and a student does not need to furnish that teacher with the complaint, or any information about the complaint.

The lawyer confirms this, suggesting that teachers ‘trust their intuition’ and be careful not to let their suspicions slide. We don’t know what other measures he took in reaction to the girl’s comments; perhaps he really did reach out to her and to her parents, realizing that she was obviously not thinking clearly about her responsibilities.

      "            This is not to say that the school was unequipped.  They had a SMART board in every classroom, a computer lab, projectors, a portable laptop station, portable television sets, three desktop computers in my room, one of which was for a child with a SEA claim.  You can understand why students did not need to bring in their own portable devices to school.\n",
      "            In my time there, the only devices I saw students using from home was a laptop computer one child brought to school as part of a SEA claim in order to help him with word processing, which he greatly benefitted from.  Students did not appear to have cell phones, mp3 players, or tablets, or at least they didn’t bring them to school.\n",
      "            I began by trying to categorize the uses of the technologies into Type I and Type I.  It seemed like most of the technologies, although new and plentiful, were used to teach the same things in the same way they had traditionally been taught (Type I).  The SMART board, when it did work, was used as a glorified projector, to show educational clips, websites, and movies.  When it wasn’t used by teachers to display information, it was used like a whiteboard when student interaction with the SMART board took place.  Such would be expected from a portable television set, but not so much from an interactive board.\n",
      "            When the students were taken to the computer lab, it was mostly to do research on different topics they had been discussing in class, which is another example of a Type I use, or for word processing, which may be considered Type II.  Even though the internet allows for us to access more information a lot faster, this use still cannot be categorized as Type II (“uses which constitute a new and better way of teaching (Maddux & Johnson, 2005))”.  This is not to say that Type I uses do not have their merits, but that having so many expensive forms of technology at one’s disposal should be justified by better use, which fully captures the capabilities of the technology.  Traditional uses can be achieved for a lot less money.\n",
      "            I must say that I am also to blame for using the technology as Type I.  I was teaching most of the classes after all.  In an attempt to take my teaching to the next level, I used the SMART board to have students interact with a simulation based on how different simple machines worked, and why they helped to make work easier.  The students were allowed to compare various combinations and explain why some were better than others.\n",
      "            Clearly, we still have a long way to go.  Just having the technology does not necessarily mean that it will be used to its fullest potential.  I saw this first hand.  In order for technology to add value to learning, it must be used in ways that allow the learner to interact with and control the outcomes.  Type II technologies attempt to do this, whereas Type I technologies, in a way, deny the existence of technology itself.\n",

      "8,1099,1,           My placement took place in the Epilepsy Classroom at the Hospital for Sick Children. The special education class consisted of 7 students between grades four and six. These students had severe learning needs. Throughout the four weeks, I witnessed technology being used by both the teacher and the students. Technology ranged from the Promethean Board, to individual iPads, and computers that were equipped with assistive technology.\n",
      "            The Promethean Board was not often used for lessons since most lessons consisted of scripted Direct Instruction and were often one-on-one. The Promethean Board, however, was used for social skills lessons, mindfulness, and science (all of which did not follow the DI handbooks). In this classroom, I did not see the Promethean board being used as a tool that enhanced pedagogy. It was still being used at the first stage of the process of pedagogical development described by Higgens and Beauchamp (2007) . Higgen and Beauchamp indicate that the first stage supports didactic where the IAW is used to enhance traditional board focused didactic teaching (p. 217). Most of the time, the learning at the board was teacher directed and not interactive.\n",
      "            Although the students were not interacting, it was beneficial for them as it increased engagement. Clemens et al. (2001) described some benefits for learning when an IWB was used with very young low-attaining pupils. All these reports outline the link between the capacity of IWB technology to enliven presentation, increase pupil participation and reinforce learning (Clemens quoted by Higgens and Beauchamp, 218). The students in the epilepsy classroom were low-attaining students, and the board, in conjunction with Prezi and Youtube videos, increased participation and engagement. Videos of real-life examples of the science topics (including pollination, bees, and underwater forests) were used to create discussion which added value to learning.\n",
      "             The interactive white board was only used for brief periods of time as it was important for this group of students to be doing a variety of things during a lesson to maintain engagement. Many times, students would use individual iPads to further understand concepts in a lesson. The iPads were beneficial for learning as they offered a way to provide differentiated instruction. The students were all at different grades and abilities. Different apps and videos allowed them to understand concepts at their academic level. In addition, iPads were also beneficial to students with physical disabilities. Many times the students would sort things into categories, label diagrams, or complete puzzles relating to their unit. Some students in the classroom did not have use of one hand, so manipulating these things were much easier for them on the iPad. Often, students would play interactive math games during free time, which increased their math skills. Some math apps, however, were simply a review of concepts previously learned. These did not increase their math abilities if they did not already understand the concept.\n",
      "            In addition to iPads, Students in the class also used individual laptops equipped with WordQ, a text-to-speech and speech-to-text program. This increased value in learning as it helped them to develop thoughts and complete sentences without worrying about the physical act of writing. It also decreased spelling anxiety since the words were written out for them.  The use of assistive technology, in this case, enhanced learning as it provided access for students and empowered them in their writing assignment.\n",

      "8,1103,4,        For my final practicum, I was teaching at an independent school for students in grade four through eight.  Upon enrollment to this school all students are required to purchase a laptop and bring it to school on a regular basis.  In addition to the laptop, most students had a smartphone as well as an e-reader, iPad, or iPod.  Of the six classrooms, four were equipped with a SmartBoard.  The teachers who taught in classrooms with a SmartBoard used their laptops and their SmartBoard on a daily basis.  In the classes, which I observed that had SmartBoards, the technology was generally used effectively.  The SmartBoard was used to enhance learning by maximizing the use of student integration in lessons, as opposed to just using it as a projector or whiteboard.  In the classrooms that did not have a SmartBoard, mine included, the teachers hardly integrated any technology.  One of the classrooms had an overhead projector that was only used one time over the course of my placement.  The other teacher had a laptop that was only used for personal use.  Although I regularly integrated technology into my teaching, it was clear the students were not used to having technology present in their history classes.  This was made obvious through comments such as, “whoa, we get to watch a YouTube video?” and “Really, I need my laptop in history?”\n",
      "         While the SmartBoard was used effectively most of the time, I felt that the use of laptops and other devices were not integrated effectively at all.  Considering how much access to technology the students had, I was surprised at their inability to use the technology effectively.  For instance, students would use their devices for personal use such as email and checking and updating a variety of social media sources.  However, when the students were asked to conduct research online, create a PowerPoint or Prezi using their laptops they lacked the necessary skills to effectively use the technology for academic purposes.\n",
      "        Similarly, all the teachers and administrators at the school had smartphones that were used on a daily basis.  The school recently started a facebook page, which displays student work and their daily activities.  Consequently, teachers were always using their phones to take photos of students and upload them to the facebook page.  However, this was not used for academic purposes, mostly social media.  During my month of placement I did not observe a teacher using their smartphone for academic purposes.\n",
      "        Ultimately, while there was an abundance of technology at the school, I was surprised at how infrequently and ineffectively it was being integrated for academic purposes.  Students were not allowed to bring smartphones to class and they were unable to skillfully use programs and applications for academic purposes.  When given a choice between a text and the Internet for research purposes, students almost always chose the text option.  I was surprised by my observations at this school.  Ultimately, I believe teachers need to provide students with the skills to masterfully integrate technology and demonstrate ways in which to integrate it for academic purposes. Teachers also need to authentically integrate technology into their programming on an ongoing basis in order to model the use of technology.  While the modeling was happening at this school, the scaffolding for independent use was lacking. ,\n",

      "8,1105,2,My placement was at a private urban school in Toronto.  The school sets very clear and strict boundaries around technology usage in the school.  Students are not allowed to use cell phones or iPods in any context during school, including recess (but excluding exam study time, during which they are allowed to listen to their iPods).  They are, however, required to own a laptop for school purposes which is kept in their locker – they are only permitted to get it if the teacher has requested it previously or if the student asks.  The whole school is WiFi-enabled and all students use a student password to access the network.  Thus, student use of laptops is not prolific but it is very much a part of the school culture - students use their laptops for research, assignments, presentations, and their Student Led Interviews.  Teachers carry their cell phones on them at all times but rarely communicate with each other that way during class time.\n",
      "  Of the 8 classrooms in the school, 2 have SMARTBoards and the library has a big screen TV (used weekly for the lunch time Film Club) and 4 library computers; the latter are not used very often, mainly because of the proliferation of laptops.  Few teachers use projectors – with the small class sizes (between 3 and 12), teachers without SMARTBoards make arrangements to switch classrooms, or show videos on their laptop.  The school maintains a small selection of school cameras, but all teachers have a smartphone and usually take school-related photos and videos with their phone.  Most classrooms have a blackboard or whiteboard that teachers use frequently; one teacher laminates plain white paper to use as portable whiteboards for student use.\n",
      "  The school does not use an online educational system like Moodle or Edmodo to communicate between teachers, students, and parents.  Teachers mostly provide students with handouts.  The school maintains a website that is updated occasionally, and a newsletter is sent out by email every Friday with important dates and interesting news; more recently, the school began a Facebook account with frequent community and academic updates (mostly daily) to supplement the newsletter.  The Facebook account can only be edited by the school, and includes a tag called “Voice Faces”, which is comprised of head shots of students in the school (who remain unnamed).,\n",
      "8,1106,4,Our app is called Explain Everything. It is a $2.99 and can be bought in the itunes app store. This is a screencasting presentation tool that can be used in the classroom. Of the many uses, it may be used by teachers to start a \"flipped classroom.\" In addition, teachers can have students complete review questions with recorded audio for their peers which can uploaded on the class website, youtube channel, or even a shared classroom dropbox folder. Files can be exported as a PDFs or image files or videos. Students can communicate with each other and respond to each others presentations, answers, or homework help. Students are able to import photos and videos from their device or cloud based storage. They can also take original photos and videos from within the app. This can be used to label diagrams, have ELL students take pictures around their community and record audio and label, give mini lessons to explain concepts or illustrate theories, etc  in a fun and interactive way. One of the key features of the app is that you can edit the presentations audio and video from within the app.\n",

      "8,1107,2,With a smartboard in both classrooms that I taught in during my February practicum, and almost every student with access to a personal laptop or a library computer, I was able to observe a lot of technology integration during this practicum. Having been in classrooms with no projectors or access to computers, this was a welcome change for me. The accessibility made it easy for teachers to integrate different mediums into their lessons. Images, videos and internet research were all worked into every day’s lessons. I believe that this is very important for student learning because many of these students will access information through the internet in their daily lives.  If any student wants to know anything about a topic, chances are they will turn to google, wikipedia and youtube as a source of information. When students have this way of learning modelled for them in classes (in research projects especially), this becomes an amazing opportunity for students to learn and to practice the skill set of online research and learning. Consistent access to technology in classes also meant that any resource on the internet could easily be brought into class without the hassle of booking laptop carts or projectors. This enabled a flexibility in teaching and learning that I appreciated.\n",
      "  Rules were in place about using your personal technology device for academic use only during school hours, and the students were generally accountable to this. Ipods and mp3 devices were only to be used during silent study time and were not to be shared between students. I found that the students required little monitoring as they often had talks about responsibility, honesty and accountability for their actions. I found that far fewer students were deviant in their laptop use, and I would definitely attribute this to the school culture of mutual respect and accountability.\n",
      "  All in all, I think that the technology availability did add value to learning, because of what I said about making the learning in class relevant to how students interact with information outside of class. Additionally, the dynamic nature of online content allow students to access information in many different forms: videos, text, photos, diagrams, animations, interviews with experts, documentaries, etc. This will without a doubt enhance learning and appeals to differentiated instruction and multiple intelligences as well.  ,\n",

      "8,1109,1,      For my final practicum I was placed in a Special Education Department in the TCDSB. I had the chance to spend time in their Resource, Multiple Exceptionalities and Gifted classrooms. The school policy regarding the use of technology was made explicitly clear by administration from the very beginning. An announcement by the Vice Principal reiterated the message found on the school’s website that “if students bring electronic devices to school that they power them off in instructional domains.”[1] Abiding to this rule was something the intermediate students had trouble with. It was common to hear teachers telling students to put away devices, not to take them out in the hallways or during recesses, and reminding them devices could be confiscated.\n",
      "  By working with several teachers in the Special Education Department I observed various uses of technology. For example in the Resource class two teachers provide student support in two very distinct ways. One teacher has a more traditional method where she works individually with students, or with small groups of students around a table, using only the board, textbooks and manipulatives. The other teacher delivers instruction using only computers. Each computer has a list of bookmarked websites that contain skill and drill Math and Language activities. When students come in for extra help the teacher will instruct them to complete a specific sequence of online activities, tailoring to the targeted skills i.e., adding, subtracting or spelling. In my opinion the sole use of technology in this case does not support student learning because activities are repetitive and not challenging. Students practiced certain skills over and over but never had a chance to apply them in new contexts, nor were they able to explain their learning or work with others. I believe a blend between the two instructional approaches in the Resource room would enhance students’ overall motivation and learning. In this classroom however, I did see the benefits assistive technologies such as Kurzweil. Despite their physical and cognitive challenges, students could express their learning using this program.\n",
      "  In the Multiple Exceptionalities class the SMARTBoard served many functions all of which improved student learning. The SMARTBoard provided visuals and audio for students as they sang their morning songs. It allowed them to practice their fine motor skills by interacting with the board, and selecting and dragging appropriate responses. For children with physical challenges this was a fun way for them to improve their fine motor skills. The students in this class also used IPads to increase the number of sight words and to enhance their memory and language skills. In this classroom I felt that technologies greatly enhanced student learning all the while keeping students engaged.\n",
      "  This placement exposed me to various uses for technology in the classroom. Overall, technology added value to students’ learning when it provided access to learning that was not otherwise possible due to challenges or limitations, and when it was used in conjunction with other instructional approaches, not in place of instruction.\n",

      "Link: http://global.com2us.com/game/Sliceit\n",
      "  Slice It! can be operated on Apple devices (iPhones, iPads, etc.) and Android devices. The app, touching upon Geometry and Spatial Reasoning skills, presents players with images of both regular and irregular shapes on graph paper. There are five episodes in Slice It! and there are a multiple stages within each episode.\n",
      "  Each stage presents a distinct shape or multiple shapes, and as the user advances, the stages become more challenging than the previous. The user is responsible for cutting the shape into equal parts all the while meeting specific conditions such as how many slices to make, and how many equal pieces need to be created from the slices. Once the image is sliced, the user is able to watch the whole shape be sliced apart into the individual parts, and receives feedback on the accuracy of the sliced pieces.\n",
      "  Depending on the accuracy, the user may receive one to five star rewards. The accuracy of the slicing to create near to equal parts as well the accumulation of stars allows the user to access slicing hints if necessary in more challenging stages. The slicing results reveal whether the user has passed or failed the stage. In the case of failing the stage, the user may retry slicing the shape and apply the generated results to improve their next try. The user may also choose to advance to the next stage without retrying the failed stage, however, they will not be awarded stars for this.\n",
      "  We believe that this app can support student learning by providing them with visual representations of what can sometimes be abstract concepts such as; symmetry, fractions, percentages, ratios, etc. Through the app users can visually see the effects of manipulating a whole object or shape to create smaller pieces of a whole. We see relevancy of this app and the cross curricular connections it can have in Mathematics, Language and Visual Arts.,\n",

      "8,1114,1,The Bishop Strachan School’s Junior Division (K-6) is exemplary in its truly seamless integration of technology to enhance student learning and teacher operational efficiency. While teachers in other schools with 1:1 laptop programs may still control when in a lesson students are allowed to use their laptops for specific activities, access to computers at BSS seems no different than access to notebooks or pencils. Teachers do not worry about competing to book “research periods in the computer lab” in advance. Rather, the Junior School has one laptop/iPad available for every three students, which students may borrow from carts in the hallway. In addition, every classroom has a SMART Board around five desktop computers. Thus, instructional time can be focused on learning, with students deciding what tools best suit their learning needs.\n",
      "  Student preference for using computers or iPads often depended on the nature of the class activity. For text-heavy purposes and research, laptops were used because of the availability of word-processing software and a physical keyboard. iPads were preferred for most other activities, especially for those involving group collaboration. They are convenient for fast-paced activity first and foremost because of their portability and ability to be quickly turned on and off, making quick information retrieval and sharing highly efficient.\n",
      "  The distinguishing feature of iPads which made them more of a necessity for many classes is its vast collection of apps, pre-installed by BSS’s ICT Integration Department. Many of these apps are programmed to carry out specialized tasks, such as a free chronophotography app called ActionShot that allowed science students to plot the trajectory of their own paper airplanes in flight by superimposing multiple photos captured every 250 milliseconds. During my practicum, the IT Department was in the process of installing Apple TV receivers in multiple classrooms. This would open huge possibilities for collaborative and presentational activity on iPads for both students and teachers, such as using multi-user whiteboard apps that allow users to conveniently show their thought processes. As well, the Apple TV avoids the “lag time” of having to export student work to a format that is compatible with the computer connected to the projector. For example, one app that significantly enriched student learning about airplane structure in my flight unit was Autodesk’s 123D Catch, whereby users take 20-40 photographs of an object from multiple angles to create a 3D model. Students could share their designs with the class and visualize the aerodynamics underlying their unique modifications to the paper airplane, rather than relying on a generic, static diagram from a Google Images search.\n",
      "  All such instances of technology integration at BSS are made possible by a strong technological infrastructure, maintained by an IT Department of five members. Three ICT integrators collaborate with teachers to make technologically rich lessons possible by providing resources, offering professional development opportunities, and co-planning lessons with teachers.,\n",
      "8,1115,2,I was placed at a middle school in TDSB, located in the Jane and Finch area, and has approximately 550 students from grades 6-8.  On the second floor of the school, I had access to a laptop cart of approximately 29 laptops that would be signed out by teachers on only my floor. Each floor had it's own laptop cart, and there was a computer lab on the main floor with approximately 30 computers, though at least 10 of them were either in need of repair or not working effectively. There were at least two students from my classes who did not have an email address, and at least 5 who did not have access to the Internet at home.\n",
      "  During my one opportunity to observe a class where my Associate Teacher (AT) taught Computers, she explained that she was not confident with technology and did not feel confident teaching students to use it when she lacked expertise. She did however, have experience using the MS Office Suite, and her lesson featured her reading aloud a short essay, which students were to type out as dictated. Students were limited by available technology (computers), and comfort with typing. Although there were a handful of students who were successful at this activity, the majority of the class had extreme difficulty. The pedagogical approach, as well as the technological literacy, was alarming.\n",
      "  Once I had the opportunity to teach myself, there was little in place in terms of regulation of technology - there wasn't a school based set of rules or a clear initiative, they generally referred back to TDSB policies. My AT seemed unsure, or at least unaware, and went to the TDSB website to find policies. When I asked if I could provide 10 minutes at the start of the class for them to check their email or have online free time, she said that they were not allowed to use the Internet for their personal use outside teacher supervised classwork. Despite being in keeping with the TDSB Code for Online Conduct policy, 4.2.1, which states that “If such [inappropriate] material is accessed by accident, the incident must be reported immediately to a teacher or appropriate authority” - I was worried about how excessive regulation might lead to further misuse. Given that Chris Spence claims: \"Technology is no longer an option; it's an essential tool for learning. Our students have grown up in a digital world and it's important that we effectively use technology to engage them in the classroom\" (2012), I was frustrated with what my school had to work with, and the attitude to technology, as I experienced it.\n",
      "  From my experience, I saw that teachers lack the confidence with technology, and are not being pushed to integrate technology into their classes. Technology is being used as a way to type up essays and research (poorly) on the Internet. Based on the TDSB, “the appropriate use of technology in schools to enable powerful teaching practices has been increasingly recognized as a force in education to excite student learning” (Our Technology Infrastructure), however, if teachers are not given support in how to teach using technology, then they will revert back to the ways they use technology and will not encourage students to be creative.\n",

      "8,1118,1,  For my observation, I decided to compare two different practicum situations within the same board to show how much a teacher influences the way technology is used in school. I have seen a range of technology available and used in different ways by staff and students.\n",
      "  In one classroom where the teacher was very excited by technology use and its possibilities for the classroom, technology was integrated into every aspect of the literacy program. Students brought their own devices, which ranged from iPads to cellphones and laptops, which were all used daily. The classroom also had a set of laptops for students to borrow. There was pretty much a ratio of 1 piece of technology for each student. Further, there was a smart board that the teacher used daily. The use of technology had a natural flow in the classroom. My associate teacher had a personal iPad, which she used to post to the classroom blog and record anecdotal notes among other daily tasks. She was well versed in educational technology and gave me many resources to access online including her personal LiveBinder.\n",
      "  Although the students had access to personal technology during class time, I did not see them abuse it. They were in grade 7 and 8 and were given free time to work on assignments using technology often unsupervised in the hallway. My AT was not worried about monitoring their online conduct. The students were using their technology for the right purposes – creating a glogster, prezi or powerpoint for a poetry anthology for example. I believe this is because they were engaged in what they were doing. Students enjoyed putting together their poetry anthology using a technology of their choice. They were excited to find pictures and videos that helped them present their poems. I saw students use their technology to benefit their learning - they were not distracted by it. I think the culture of the classroom was set up in a way that created a respect and an environment where appropriate technology use was the norm.\n",
      "  In a different school but within the same board, I saw technology from the school available to staff and students, but my AT was not integrating it into her grade 4 program. She seemed worried about the inconveniences technology could bring to her classroom and was not interested in extending her own learning. There was a cart with a class set of netbooks available for student use, as well as a Smartboard to be shared between 3 classes. My AT took no initiative to learn how to use the smart board. She did not encourage students to use the netbooks, which she felt wasted a lot of time setting up and shutting down. Only students who were “truly struggling” with writing by hand were permitted to access netbooks for their summary writing. I persuaded my AT to let me create a class Edmodo for my students to access at home. I set it up and got each student logged on. The students participated on Edmodo and posted frequently. Students posted questions about homework, or comment on a game I had posted. Students would come to school the next day and would be excited to tell me about something they posted on Edmodo - I felt like it was bringing the learning inside the classroom home with them. I would say at least half of my students logged on to Edmodo each night. When I left, the class Edmodo stayed active because my AT learned how to use it. She continues to post homework and reading response questions online and the students are very engaged by it.\n",
      "  It has become clear to me that availability of equipment is not the only factor that leads to use of technology in the classroom. The classroom teacher greatly influences whether or not technology will be used.,\n",
      "8,1119,4,I had my final practicum in the Grade 2/3 Toronto District School Board (TDSB) Section 23 CATCH classroom at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). There were eight male students in my classroom, one special education teacher, and two Child and Youth Workers (CYWs). I quickly became aware of student and teacher use of technology that existed in the classroom and as well, I was made aware of the lack of technology in the classroom and the potential it could have in this special education environment.\n",
      "  When walking into the classroom, two computers were visible, one on the teacher’s desk in the corner and the other on the Child and Youth Workers desk. These two computers were mainly used by the adults in the room. The teacher used her computer constantly for such things as attendance, lesson planning, and report card writing. CYWs needed constant access to these computers for report writing. Three other computers were available for student use in a group room down the hall from the classroom. Each day, during the literacy centre that involved technology, a pair of students would get the opportunity to work on the computer to access the BookFLIX program where they would listen to a book being read to them as they followed along with the highlighted words. Students had the opportunity to use headphones for this. Depending on student behavior and the availability of staff, students would either have to be logged onto the teacher and CYW computers to complete their literacy centre technology activity or they would go with one adult to the group room to work on the computers there. Students also had the opportunity to use the computers during reading and writing activities where they could use the assistive technology program, Read and Write Gold, for literacy support. Again, not all students had access to the technology at the same time due to limited technological resources for the classroom.\n",
      "  There were only three iPads available for the students in the classroom. Being able to use an iPad was a privilege. It was during occasional math and language periods that the teacher would designate certain students to use the iPad for learning purposes. The iPads were equipped with previously downloaded Math or Language games that appropriately linked to the curriculum at hand. Student iPad use needed to be closely monitored as students would easily access other games and applications. Some of the students had their own iPads and they were only allowed to play them after school and once they got on the bus. Depending on their behaviour and on the amount of chips accumulated during the school week, students would have the option of using their own iPads on Fun Friday.\n",
      "  There were only whiteboards in the classroom. There was access to an overhead projector but it was not used during my practicum. My associate teacher expressed her frustrations with the lack of technology and associated resources for this highly specialized classroom. As a Special Education specialist with many related teaching experiences, my associate teacher expressed that a SmartBoard would be highly beneficial for these students in this type of classroom.\n",
      "  I accompanied my Associate Teacher to an iPad workshop where Section 23 educators gathered to share useful iPad games and applications. An instructor was also present to share with the group specific games and applications that could be beneficial to some of the unique classrooms. This workshop was mildly beneficial. Unfortunately, the games and applications presented were not grade level appropriate for my students.\n",

      "8,1121,1,  Practicum Observation\n",
      "              For my final practicum, I was teaching at a Middle School, grades 6 through 8.  I had had a practicum at this school last year, however the change in use of technology over the past year was outstanding.  The area in which this middle school is located is extremely diverse, with many of its students living in subsidized housing, newcomers to Canada, from affluent parts of the neighbourhood and so on.  Upon entering the school it became extremely apparent that the school had put an incredible amount of funding into its technology.  There was a Smartboard located in almost every classroom, and those classrooms that did not have Smartboards as of yet, were going to be receiving one in the near future.  In the classrooms that had Smartboards, including mine, they were used effectively.  They became far more than a glorified whiteboard and were successful in incorporating student engagement and active participation throughout all lessons.  From mathematics to History, the teacher and myself used the Smartboard.  It was clear that the students had become quite accustomed to using the boards, due to their wealth of knowledge of its functions and capabilities.  I knew this because as I was conducting a lesson the students would say “Miss, why don’t you pull up the tools on the laptop?” or “You can use the pen to highlight too.”  Not only was it great to see their understanding of technology, it was a great way for me to build my students’ confidence by learning from them.\n",
      "            Along with the Smartboard, there are a number of laptop carts available within the school.  I believe there are 2, however, I was fortunate enough to have one of the carts in my classroom throughout my entire practicum.  As well, my AT had access to her own personal laptop for report card writing, lesson planning, and researching.  For a large portion of the classes students were able to use laptops to type up their work and conduct research as well.  The students ability to type and navigate on the laptops was extremely high, however, it became clear that their foundational ability to spell was not at grade level.  This was very interesting to me that the students were able to use the laptops without issues.  However, they were not able to construct a clear sentence without spelling and grammar errors.  That aside, for the sake of discussing technology, the students were able to conduct research, put PowerPoint presentations together, create storyboards, and navigate the laptop’s many programs.  The students requested to use the technology as much as possible for a wealth of reasons.  Many of the students did not have technology at home, therefore, their ability and option to use it at school was in a sense, a motivational tool for them.\n",
      "            Similarly, all the teachers and administrators in the school were extremely well versed in the technology that the school had readily available.  In addition to the school’s technology, students and staff had their own personal devices, mainly smartphones.  Their phones were not allowed in the classroom, or to be used during school time, which included recess and lunch.  However, it was interesting to see some of the teachers using their phones for social media purposes, to take photographs, or play music during class time.  At no point in time did I observe a teacher using their phones for academic purposes.  I found this made students more inclined to bring their phones to class, even though they were not allowed to use them.\n",
      "            With all of the technology available within the school, students were able to achieve a great deal of successful research and assignment completion.  They were well versed in the uses of each of the technologies available.  If the students were ever given a choice of using the laptops or not, 99% of the time they chose to use the technology.  The teachers at the school did a tremendous job of integrating technology into their lessons on a daily basis and were extremely effective in involving students in this technological journey.  However, although the use of technology was extremely effective, I believe teachers should model the rules of the school and avoid using their personal devices for personal reasons, and not academic purposes.  Teachers need to be role models for their students, and if the students are expected to not use their personal devices in class, then they should avoid it as well.  Conclusively, I found that this middle school was great for modeling the use of technology and integrating it into their daily lessons.  Thus developing the students ability to successfully use multiple forms of technology.          ,\n",

      "8,1124,2,During my second practicum I taught in a grade 7 gifted class. Honestly at first I found myself extremely frustrated with the lack of technology in the classroom. The extent of the technology consisted of a lap top cart that was shared amongst the four classes on the 2nd floor. I tried teaching my lessons in science and math without technology performing experiments and physical demonstrations, but this wasn't always possible for the specific subject matter. I am not the biggest fan of the blackboard, and I found myself re-writing the same information for my rotary science classes. A simple power point would facilitate my lessons much more efficiently.\n",
      "  Although during practicum you abide to the routines already established, I took it upon my self to incorporate at least a little bit of technology into the classroom. I borrowed a projector from one teacher, speakers from another, and the necessary cords I needed to conduct a power point. Once managing to acquire all the equipment, I realized that the screen was located behind my AT's desk where students were unable to view it. I was allowed to rearrange the the desks, and ended up using a piece of white chart paper as a projector screen. After jumping through hoops in getting simple technology into my classroom it was evident that it was well worth it. The technology reinforced student learning, was used as a classroom management tool, and engaged the creative minds of the students in the gifted program.\n",
      "  During my first week of practicum classroom management was my greatest concern. The simple technology of an overhead proved to help with this issue. Students were interested in what was on the screen. For class A I performed a lesson on Solar Energy with the use of the blackboard and images on a sheet in front of each student. I found that I was often guiding students to stay on task and that they would lose focus much more easily. When I used the projector with the same lesson plan for class B, they were much more focused on the vibrant pictures that the entire class was looking at together. With just the blackboard they easily tuned out, the projector was a tool I used that captured their attention.\n",
      "  Using the projector to show short YouTube clips on Conventional Energy Sources was a great way to reinforce student learning. In this particular lesson I posted the exact energy diagrams from the textbook on the screen. I would first go over the diagram as a class, the students would then go over it individually or in small groups, then we would conclude with a short clip to further understandings. My students enjoyed the clips most of all, and I heard comments such as \"o that it enters the reactor like that\". The projector simply made the topic Energy Sources much more engaging then the textbook.\n",
      "  Technology is an important factor in teaching in the 21st century, there are 4 year old kids who are able to work an I-pad better then some adults. I truly believe that technology can make both lesson plans better as well as teachers. When leaving my practicum my AT discussed how she would like to use the projector and different programs more in the future. She observed her students positive response and was pleased with the outcome. With this specific group of students they all flourished with new Ideas and different forms of technology. With many different working habits and behaviors, putting up different challenges on the projector provided great extensions to assignments, activities, and learning goals.\n",

      "Student and Teacher Use of Technology\n",
      "    This practicum I was placed in the same school as my second practicum, a year ago this time. It was interesting for me to see if the use of technologies has changed in the school over the course of the year, be it school wide, teacher use, or student use. The reality is, nothing has changed.\n",
      "  Most classrooms are equipped with a SMARTboard. That being said, they are also still equipped with the traditional chalk board which I found still more popular among the teachers even with the oversized, interactive, touch-screen computer hanging in the classes.  The reason for this I’m not sure, but I can surmise that since it is an older school (literally an older building and teachers and staff older as well) that as long as the older, traditional means are still available (i.e. the chalk board and over head projectors), then the traditional means they will continue to use.\n",
      "  Specifically now, my AT did in fact make use of her SMARTboard both this time around and the last. However, after seeing how my AT used it in this years fall placement, I realize how little she really knows about its nuances and true capabilities. For her purposes it acts as a glorified overhead, one that does not hum nor leaves a marker residue on one’s fingers. Although, I give her credit for trying to bring it in (now more often than before) and even allow her students to interact with it as well.\n",
      "  My AT does a movie trailer project with the grade 8 students, after learning about genre and what goes into a movie trailer. For this project, the students use iphones, ipads, lap tops, video cameras, whatever they need, to film their very own movie trailers. I have seen students create and utilize their own green screens, and add special effects- it is all so amazing what they can do, and this process allows them to utilize both their creativity and their desire to utilize technology in the school.\n",
      "  The general rule at school for all students is that phones may come to school, but they are to stay in their lockers over the course of the day. For middle school students who go off campus at lunch, they may take their phones, and as soon as the bell goes at the end of the day, their phones are allowed to come out. Interestingly, in my two practicum at the, at the intermediate level, I have never seen the phone rule being an issue. I have never seen a cell phone in my classroom, or in the halls aside from the end of the day or right after lunch.\n",
      "  Majority of the middle school students have their computers and they may bring them to class when they please, as long as they adhere to the teachers’ rules regarding their use of them. During lunch, which is spent in spent in the classrooms prior to going outside, no computers are allowed. However, if students choose not go outside for recess, they may stay in with a teacher on duty and use their computers.\n",
      "  In my observations of the use of technology in the school, the rules seem to be a good fit. I have yet to see or hear of any problems, nor have I been interrupted by a cell phone or caught a student texting. Sometimes if the students are doing class work on their computers, I have seen them playing a game, but I have never had to ask more than once to refrain from doing so.\n",
      "  Generally speaking, the classroom I was in was not “advanced” in incorporating technology, per se, however nor was it opposed it. I found there was a pretty god balance between using technology and not using it- in such a way that the students respected it. ,\n",
      "8,1128,1,  Practicum Observation # 2\n",
      "Alicia Krumholz\n",
      "Walking into my classroom on the first day I was instantly overwhelmed. I noticed a Smartboard sitting in the corner of the room. While this sight would excite most of my peers, I was petrified. Before this practicum I had never used the Smartboard and had sworn it off as my enemy. I was happy to learn that although my teacher had the privilege of a Smartboard in this classroom, he never used it. By the middle of the second week I was convinced by my peers to try it out.\n",
      "  Wow! It’s an amazing tool and so easy to use, I incorporated it into so many lessons after that initial point. However, I did notice that it was hard to involve all students in the lesson when getting some to interact with the board. After using the Smartboard a few times I developed a solution to this problem. My favorite use of the Smartboard was for consolidation. I found it to be a wonderful tool to use with a small group of students at a time. Consequently, when students were doing seatwork, I would call up a 3-4 students to complete the consolidation activity. This allowed me to keep anecdotal notes of student progress and highlighted to me who was struggling and needed some more support. My teacher was really inspired by these activities and asked that I teach him how to use the Smartboard.\n",
      "  Another interaction I had with technology in my practicum was during an individual assignment in literacy. The students were tasked with researching and writing a biography on a famous Canadian. Students were allowed to bring in their own technology from home pending the permission of their parents through a form. Although many students were able to bring in equipment I saw a lot of jealousy in my grade 5 classroom. Many students were visibly upset an expressed a sadness in having to use the “old school computers”, while others used their new fast iPads. This is a constant concern I have had with students bringing in their own technology into the classroom. How do you explain to other students that this is a fact of life? Further, an interesting dichotomy exists, in allowing students to bring in their own technology other students get upset, but, if those students did not bring in their own devices, the school did not have a class set of laptops for use of all the students.\n",
      "  Although technology has its benefits I believe there are still many wrinkles that need to be ironed out, like equity, before educators can integrate technology in a meaningful way. ,\n",

      "                I had the pleasure of working with an associate teacher that had a genuine interest in integrating technology into the classroom and curriculum. There was an abundant use of technology by both students and teachers in this class. Our homeroom was located in the library, allowing students to have regular access to its 7 desktop computers. Students were encouraged to use the computers during language classes for many purposes including research, writing, and preparing presentations. The school also had a portable Mac cart that contained enough MacBooks for each student to use.

      "8,1133,1,            During my practicum at Redstone Public School, I felt that my students made little use of the available technology. My associate teacher was not tech savvy and the classroom only had two computers and 5 laptops. Due to the limited amount of computers available in each classroom, students had to borrow laptops from other classrooms to complete assignments. For Language class, the limited amount of computers was not an issue because they used the daily five for language, allowing students to work on other tasks if a laptop or computer was unavailable. However, the lack of laptops would make it difficult to research material or type good copies of written work for any other subject.\n",
      "              Although the classroom itself had a limited supply of technology, Redstone had a large amount of technological equipment available. There was an iPad cart available to any teacher if they signed for it in the library. Personally, I signed out the iPads and made them available to my students when I was teaching my science lessons on renewable and non-renewable resources. The iPads allowed students to use the internet and research topical and pertinent information. Since technology was not widely used in the classroom, the iPads were seen as a treat. I often saw students fooling around with the iPads; taking pictures of themselves and making videos. I believe iPads have the potential to be a powerful tool for learning as students can easily interact (through touching the screen) with the iPad. However, it is important that a teacher not only uses iPads in class, but also models and periodically monitors appropriate behaviour when using the iPads. They should be treated as learning tools and not toys.\n",
      "              Redstone also had a number of SmartBoards available for teachers and students. Although my associate teacher was not a big fan of using the SmartBoard in her lessons, I used the SmartBoard quite regularly throughout the practicum. To enhance my mathematics unit, I used the SmartBoard everyday for demonstrating how to translate, rotate, and reflect shapes. I also uploaded various teaching games (Who Wants to be a Millionaire and Jeopardy) for science and math which the students really enjoyed. The SmartBoard itself is a fantastic tool for both teachers and students to use because it is very engaging for students and anxiously came to the front of the class to interact with it. This interaction encouraged participation and allowed students to better learn and apply course content. I enjoyed creating unique lessons for my students and seeing them very engaged in the material they were learning.\n",
      "              After using and observing laptops, SmartBoards, and iPads in the classroom, I could readily see and appreciate their benefit. In particular, the SmartBoard was extremely beneficial as I would have had difficulties teaching and demonstrating rotations and reflections without it. Using my words to explain how to rotate an object is difficult for me, but I was able to teach it using SmartBoard technology. In order to see the benefits, technology needs to be used often by both teachers and students. If technological equipment is not modelled properly and used appropriately, there is no way that teachers and students can truly beneficially experience what technology can bring to a classroom.,\n",
      "8,1134,1,My placement was in a grade 6-8 Special Education classroom with the TDSB. Technology was always present in and out of the classroom environment. The school is located in a diverse racial, cultural and socio-economic neighborhood. Despite varying economic situations, all of my students owned cell phones, and they even made fun of my ‘old fashioned’ black berry. Despite their obvious presence, students were strictly forbidden to use their cell phones in class and their use was limited to before school, at lunch or after school.\n",
      "         The administration has allocated a vast amount of funds to enhancing technology use in the school. In the last two years the school has purchased four Promethean boards, and a set of twenty i-Pads for the library. There is also a computer lab and two mobile mac labs in the school. Naturally, technology practice varied around the school depending on teacher’s experience and comfort level.\n",
      "         My students seemed to have technology integrated throughout the school day. We had a Promethean board in the classroom, and it was used as the main instructional tool. My associate teacher was still exploring and struggling to learn how to use the Promethean to facilitate a more interactive learning environment, but she did use it consistently. Furthermore, because of the students individual education needs there was a computer for each student in the class. However, despite the fact that I was working in a special education classroom, I was surprised that Read and Write Gold seemed to be the only adaptive technology used.\n",
      "         I did go to my student’s rotary classes and found that technology was used throughout the day. The library utilized their new i-Pads to facilitate interactive learning activities. The music teacher also used the i-Pads to create sound bites and mix songs. The science and technology teacher used the smart board as his main instructional tool.\n",
      "         In my discussions with staff members there seemed to be a general reluctance when it came to technology. For example, I over heard one teacher telling the staff that her daughter was allowed to use her cellphone in class, because she went to a BYOD school, and most staff members were appalled and saw that as a classroom management disaster. Overall despite the integration and presence of technology I believe teachers need further professional development and guidance to first gain acceptance of technology as a valid learning tool and second in making it supportive of the learning instead of just a fancy and expensive instructional tool.,\n",

      "                Tech is heavy on my mind and one of my personal priorities in my classrooms (each teacher has their own particular focus, and this is mine). When I saw Pierre Laporte Middle School, I didn’t think I’d have much to work with. It is located in a low SES area, and my previous experience was that it was affluent parent councils that put the tech in the classroom.\n",
      "                To my surprise, my gifted class had 8 macbooks and a smartboard. It doesn’t sound like much, but it was the PERFECT number of devices for 17 students. These 8 macbooks weren’t enough for my classes of 28 students which I saw during rotary: I had to book our school’s “Mobile Computing Strategy” laptop cart (a TDSB initiative which looks like an armoured tank with massive fans on it to cool all the PCs down). Luckily, the cart was not in consistent high demand like in the other schools I worked at.\n",
      "                My students knew how to use various programs on the macs, including music and video editing software. They all had internet access at home as well. In fact, they begged me for my email so I created a misterelgeries email so they could continue to ask me questions/keep in touch, both to protect my privacy and my sanity.\n",
      "                My AT was encouragingly better at tech than what I expected for a teacher with a SmartBoard. She even gave me some music lessons she had ordered that utilized the SmartBoard.\n",
      "                One concern I continue to have is how to optimally deliver lessons when some students may not have the internet at home. I knew my homeroom students had access, and I really appreciated the freedom of doing internet-based follow-up work or pre-work. It was so good, that I would feel bad retarding a whole class from this efficient process for the sake of 1 or 2 students that don’t have internet access at home. It’s sad to say, but those students may just have to come in to school early, go to the school library, or worst case scenario, the public library. It is a lot to ask and may cause a serious imposition for the parents, but it is the only viable option in light of delivering a less efficient curriculum than possible. If it was practically impossible, I’d just sacrifice some of my lunch so they could internet whatever I assign (yes, I just used internet as a verb).,\n",
      "8,1138,3,\"I'll trade you my iPad time for more desktop computers, heck, I'll trade you the smartboad that doesn't work too well for more desktop computers, OR a whole set of ipads for my class\"\n",
      "  Technology in my treatement centre placement was a juggling act.  Desktop computers were used just as much as a student learning tool (scribing, research, etc) as it was a therapeuitc tool (able to do independent study, music when stressed, a chance to play a game and check out).  Our smart board wa san interactive learning tool, but one that only worked for two weeks due to being unplugged (how did we not see that!?).\n",
      "  I used my ipad in this practicum and it was the first time the students had seen one in use by a teacher before, and my teacher did not use one, nor did I see them in use at school.  The students recognized that I was using the ipad and using it to keep track of marks and lessons and things to show them.  I used a modified web-cam for my small class to show them works in progress that I really liked, and they loved seeing it in action, but I think it was unfamiliar enough, that they didn't take it into account as much (well, more chicken legs apppeared on their sculptures than before I showed the chicken leg sculpture).  Technology for me was about connecting with the students, making things entertaining and useful for them.  Wherease technology in the class (aside from our smart-board) was really seen as either a tool, a toy or an afterthought.  I didn't aks my AT about her thoughts on technology and how to integrate it, and I showed her some interesting apps on the ipad that piqued he rinterest, but her repsonse wasn't to adapat it right away.\n",
      "  I feel like this probably has to do with the facility, the focus in the centre was on treatment of the students with their educaiton coming second.  I can only wonder what it would do for students and treatment if technology had been integrated in more for therapeutic purposes as well as educaitonal ones.,\n",

      "8,1141,1,  During this practicum, I had the opportunity to teach grade 9 and 10 English at a TCDSB high school. On my observation days, I was impressed with the amount of technology being used in my AT’s classrooms as students were using laptops from a rolling lab to complete ISU’s and were allowed to listen to music on their own personal devices with headphones on while they worked independently if the students and the teacher felt it could help them focus on the task. In addition to this, not only did the classroom have a projector mounted on the ceiling facing one wall, but a smart board mounted on the opposite wall. Every classroom in the English hall was outfitted with the same and just down the hall was the most amazing computer lab I have ever seen with over 60 iMacs, amazing audio and video equipment, DSLR cameras and more.\n",
      "  Needless to say, I came into my practicum with the idea that my students and I would be using technology easily each day (I had been using Smart Boards in my last two practicums), but on my first day I was proven wrong as I clearly hadn’t observed closely enough.  Though the smart board was mounted, it had not been turned on since it was mounted over a year ago because the power cord wasn’t long enough to reach the outlet and there was no extension cord,  none of the English teachers received training on how to use it and none had found the time to figure it out after school themselves or purchase an extension cord. The ones who were using it were actually wheeling in their own personal projector and laptop and just using it as a white screen to project on to (why they weren’t using the one mounted on the ceiling is beyond me).  Teachers were also not given laptops and none of the classrooms had desktop computers, so they were frustrated with the expectation that they had to provide their own laptops to use as well.  For the first two weeks of practicum, I tried to use the Smart Board but the speakers wouldn’t work and it wouldn’t calibrate – it was essentially a projector and screen.  I spent those weeks asking if someone could come in to look at it and though my AT tried to help me trouble shoot, it seemed like it was going to continue to just collect dust.  Then suddenly in my third week of practicum a technical assistant showed up out of nowhere during school and started working on it. Again, like my last practicum, I did not let him leave the class until everything was working perfectly.  My AT then explained that I was lucky that I saw him during school hours and could trouble shoot with him because technical assistants often come and go without the issues being fully solved or without speaking to teachers so they never learn what the issues are and how to solve anything themselves (with the fault likely lying in many factors, not just the technician). In addition to challenges with the class’ equipment, to book a rolling lab or a computer lab often took four weeks notice which was incredibly limiting and even problematic because I can’t imagine a teacher knowing what exactly their day plans are four weeks in advance.\n",
      "  After it was fixed and I began using it as an actual Smart Board I was surprised to hear that most of the students had never seen a teacher use one, even though a lot of their teachers had one for over a year. To me it is such a shame because I know how expensive they are and I know how much my students enjoyed using one.  I do have to give my AT credit though because he was using Twitter with his Grade 12 Writer’s Craft class as an experiment and after I showed him my classroom wiki (which was my experiment for the semester!) he decided to continue using it with the students after I left as well. I know that he would love to use more technology in his classes, so I wish there was more PD available for him to learn more, outside of what I tried to teach him or even just more consideration on the tools that are invested in (like a smart board but no computer or power cord).\n",
      "  The other piece of technology that I saw everywhere in our school was cellphones. As they are high school students, I think many more students than I was expecting had their own personal cell phones. They were allowed to bring it to school and while I’m not sure what the exact policies were for students using it in the hallways or at lunch, they were everywhere and being used all the time.  I appreciated the fact that my AT allowed students to use their cell phones for music or to use apps, but I found that because the school and my teacher had such flexible (maybe even nonexistent) cell phone policies in place I was always stuck battling with students over their phone. In the end, I welcomed students’ use of cell phones to listen to music during silent writing time, record homework, and go on our class wiki, but I often felt frustrated because I couldn’t actually control what students were doing with their phones (i.e. as soon as we were wrapping up class students who recorded homework with their phone would be busy doing that, while others would try to convince me that they were doing the same while they were really just texting.) When I left the school I suggested to my AT that more PD could be done around technology and that clearer expectations were needed for students use of technology, but I hope that my examples at least inspired him and the other teachers in my department to think more about using technological and online tools (for example, dropbox).,\n",

      "8,1144,1,              I spent my second practicum this year at Pierre Laporte Middle School, in the Toronto District School Board.  When it came to the use of technology during class time, my associate teacher often used the SMARTboard as an instructional tool and students often used the computers during their library period.  My associate teacher often used YouTube to show video clips that were tied to the lessons.  Although I didn’t see them used during my stay at the school, several assistive technologies were also mentioned during staff meetings, with a brief tutorial held on how to best use them.  I also saw students using listening centers in some classrooms during literacy periods.  Cell phones and personal electronic devices were typically not permitted in class, but from time to time, my associate teacher allowed the students to bring them in to assist their work on certain assignments.\n",
      "                       I noticed that the majority of students were familiar with technology and many owned personal electronic devices.  I saw many iPods, mp3 players, and cell phones.  Although cell phones were not allowed during class times, I often saw students using cell phones and iPods in the hallways and during recess times.  My students often spoke of technology and mentioned the use of computers and video game systems at home.  Through my experiences this practicum, it was clear to me that technology played a big role in the lives of the students that I was working with.  Not only was it a popular topic of conversation, but also the activities that they chose to engage in during free time, both at school and outside of school, were often connected in some way to the use of technology.  ,\n",

      "8,1146,1,  My second practicum came with surprises and adjustments. Following three successful placements, where I was fortunate to heavily integrate technology; I suddenly found myself struggling in a placement with minimal technologies. During my latest teaching experience at Wilclay Public School in the York Region District School Board, the technological presence was at a bare minimum. Some classes even continued to use overhead projectors, while only two classes had available Smartboard. This struggle led to my personal initiatives to incorporate technology into teaching, and learning. By incorporating an elmo, Edmodo and Prezi, I am confident that I have independently incorporated technology into my teaching.\n",
      "  During the beginning of my practicum, I was focused on observations, and following the routines of my Associate Teacher. While I was working with grades seven and eight on rotary, I learned that most classes did not have contemporary technologies in the classroom. Most classes possessed an overhead projector as their primary technological resource. I had difficulty planning lessons with the possibility of teaching without technology. After asking my Associate Teacher for possible technological resources, she brought an Elmo into the class as a daily device. This device lessened my anxiety of teaching without technology but led to an epiphany towards technology. I learned that my unrest with teaching without technology came as these devices made both teaching and learning simpler.\n",
      "  Later into my placement, I came across experiences regarding communication with parents. In past teaching experiences, I found that online communication with parents through blogs or websites have been efficient and useful. In this class, communication was through printed newsletters. This practice led to notes being sent back and forth between parents to clarify wording. I learned that these communications would have been made clearer through online communication.\n",
      "  Towards the end of my placement, I began to integrate technology into every lesson. By using the Elmo and Smartphones, I had the ability to extend the learning outside the classroom. I was able to share videos and websites when they became relevant to the context of the lesson. Additionally, I chose to integrate technology into an assessment of learning. I created a co-curricular evaluation for Media Literacy and Mathematics using Prezi. This assignment was found to be engaging and created self-motivation. By creating an evaluation that linked technology with curriculum expectations,\n",
      "  In summary, my latest teaching experience emphasized that technology must be integrated into ones education. A lack of technology negatively impacts both the student and teacher. Without sufficient technology, it limits a teachers’ ability to communicate effectively with students and parents. Furthermore, the lack of technology restricts learning as lessons and assessments lack real-world connectivity and engagement. This final placement has been eye opening. While every technology may not always be accessible; I am certain that I will make an effort to consistently integrated any available resources in order to engage and provoke student learning.\n",

      "  Description:\n",
      "Anki is an adaptive flashcard program, and is typically associated with language learning. Users can create their own virtual card decks or download decks created by other people. These decks can contain text, pictures, or audio. Anki is adaptive in the sense that once you have mastered a card, it will appear less frequently. Conversely, if you are experiencing difficulty with a card, it will appear within a minute or less to increase the likelihood of memorization.\n",
      "  Some uses include: language acquisition, studying for medical and law exams, remembering chords for guitar playing, or fine tuning knowledge of geography.\n",
      "  Means’ Categories and Bruce & Levin’s Categories:\n",
      "Ankiweb does not fit into the Bruce & Levin’s categories. It is neither media for expression, nor for communication, and it also doesn’t fit as media for construction as flashcards remain a rote memorization-type task. (Levin & Bruce, 2001) However, since Ankidroid is so versatile, it falls under two of Means’ categories for educational technology: technology as a tutor and as a tool. It is partially a tutor, because though the user isn’t necessarily being taught new facts or concepts while using Ankidroid, he or she will be memorizing them, which is definitely classified as learning new material (what you did not know before, you will know post-memorization – that is, you will be able to recall and deliver this information to working memory from long-term memory). Ankidroid can also be categorized as a tool. Though its purposes are educational, its primary use as a memorization tool isn’t limited to the classroom. It can be used for many personal uses such as brushing up on a language, or memorizing people’s names and faces.  (Means, 1994)\n",
      "  TPACK Framework:\n",
      "  The TPACK framework references the ability for teachers to skillfully draw upon their “teacher toolkit” of different types of knowledge. Though teachers may know about each different type of knowledge (technological, pedagogical, content), their use of technology for education is limited by their ability to apply it in the way that it will be most effectively used. (Koehler)\n",
      "  “knowledge of what makes concepts difficult or easy to learn and how technology can help redress some of the problems that students face; knowledge of students’ prior knowledge and theories of epistemology; and knowledge of how technologies can be used to build on existing knowledge to develop new epistemologies or strengthen old ones” (Koehler)\n",
      "  Ankidroid has many features that can be customized, therefore allowing teachers to use it as a technology that can assist a student’s understanding through the TPACK framework – as mentioned in the previous quote. For example, when teaching about the cell in Science, some students may have trouble remembering the different organelles and their functions, or the stages of mitosis and their names. Teachers who have content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, can then use Anki to present the information to students who need help memorizing terms. The customizable features mean that images, audio, video, or a combination of all three can be used to help students connect with and internalize the data in the way that best suits their needs.\n",

      "8,1155,4,I had the pleasure of completing my final placement at St. Maximilian Kolbe Catholic High School with the YCDSB.  This practicum experience was very different from my other experiences since I was teaching high school mathematics for the first time. St. Maximilian Kolbe CHS offers a new facility with access to a variety of technologies for both teacher and student use. The mathematics department had access to its own class set of iPads, graphing calculators, and SMART boards in each of it's classrooms. A large library was also available to students and teachers, which included brand-new Apple and PC computers, scanners, and LCD projectors. The school was equipped with wireless Internet for both student and teacher access. Each day, lessons were prepared on the SMART Board and graphing calculators were available to differentiate instruction for students who preferred a more hands-on approach to mathematical concepts. I had the opportunity to create a website for my students which included SMART board lesson plans, instructional videos to reinforce concepts, and extra math practice. Handouts were posted to the course website before class for students who wished to access material in advance. Through the course website, students were able to engage in dialogue about the material and post questions or comments for the teacher. The discussion board served as a useful opportunity to answer questions for students and share resources.\n",
      "  During my lessons, I frequently asked students to use their PEDs to access the website Poll Everyone. Furthermore, a link to the student textbook was available online for easy access. The website served as a formative assessment tool for students to readily self-assess their own understanding of course material. In addition, I made use of the class iPads to engage students in math activities and interactive games. The iPads were engaging for struggling leaners and provided a fun and collaborative way to reinforce concepts for all students. Gizmos were also implemented on a daily basis as a hook for students, which enabled them to work collaboratively on exercises and complete online assessments.\n",
      "  PEDs including iPADs, mobile devices or laptops were restricted during instructional time unless the teacher had given permission for students to use them. Students were permitted to use their PEDs between classes, in the hallways or in the school cafeteria. While on cafeteria duty, I noticed students plugged into their mobile devices texting their friends, surfing the web, using social media or scanning through their photo galleries.\n",
      "  This practicum commenced at the start of a new semester with an opening assembly for students. The school administration discussed the rules for PEDs in the school and warned students about the dangers associated with pictures and social media. Students were reminded that taking photos on their PEDs were completely forbidden in which severe consequences would be issued if necessary.\n",
      "  This high school experience varied greatly from my previous elementary school placements such that technology integration was more prominent in the school. Despite the fact that the school is new and apart of an affluent community, a culture in the school existed in which students were readily using PEDs both inside and outside the classroom. The school environment was extremely supportive of technology integration and the resources were plentiful. This was a wonderful opportunity for me as teacher candidate to learn and explore technology integration and gain a better understanding of how technology creates meaningful and authentic learning experiences for all students. ,\n",

      "8,1158,1,In my fourth and final placement, I had the opportunity to work with a more ‘tech-friendly’ associate teacher than my previous ones had been. She was admirably SMARTboard-savvy, and used it to great effect. I was expected to do the same, and she was very helpful in filling in my knowledge gaps. Nearly every Math and Language had an instructional component that featured models on the SMARTboard. Certain moments in particular impressed me; for example, for a culminating Language Arts task, students used mini whiteboards, in small groups, to brainstorm success criteria. When finished, the class culled the brainstorm to produce four or five criteria, first handwritten on the SMARTboard and then conveted into text so that they could be more easily read. This use of technology saved time and made things clearer. I’m confident that it definitely helped her to achieve her goals.\n",
      "She regularly updated the class’ EdMolo account with homework assignments and instructions. Even in February, students were still getting used to checking the site regularly and I took this as a sign that it might not be a fair expectation of them. But in general, it became a very handy way of disseminating information over the weekend. For example, because I wanted students to have the extra time, in the coming weekend, to rehearse some poetry, I posted the poems they could choose on Saturday morning. By Monday, many students had already memorized them. So I think EdModo’s efficacy in getting more work out of students is demonstrable; whether or not this is a good thing is up for debate!\n",
      "Students had access to Netbooks. The machines were a very necessary tool for our ‘neighborhood revitalization’ project, providing a good deal of information to students who could work independently.  As a compliment to the walks the students took around the neighbourhood to collect primary data ‘on the ground’, Google Maps gave students an overall picture of neighborhoods geographic, economic and architectural and infrastructural features. Twenty minutes of exploring the neighbourhood using the program could tell students more, and in a different way, than an hour of instruction or walking. I think the combination of web surfing and neighbourhood walking was vital in students producing such excellent final products and learning a lot.\n",
      "I can see a few reasons why this class’ use of technology was so successful. First, the technology was always brought out for a clear purpose that couldn’t be achieved in the same way without it. Modeling the division of negative number using counters needs to happen if all students are going to be able to do it themselves, but counters are small and difficult to see. It’s much easier to use the SMARTboard application than to draw them on the board.\n",
      "Second, the teacher had very clear instructions around technology use and misuse. I know that she spent a lot of time early on in the year teaching students how to use technology effectively and appropriately. Students respected and made better use of their learning time because of this.,\n",

      "8,1161,7,  In my most recent practicum, at Branksome Hall's Junior School, I worked with both my associate teacher in the Learning Strategies (LS) room and a Grade 5 classroom teacher (teaching math to her students). I was struck by the sheer amount of technology available for students: SMARTboards and document cameras in every classroom, iPads in the LS room loaded with educational apps, and laptop carts, which I hadn't seen in any of my prior placements.\n",
      "  The amount of technology did not necessarily lead to a more robust and enhanced use of it, however. For the most part, SMARTboards were simply glorified projector screens. While teachers used the document camera to model procedures, and displayed plenty of multimedia artifacts in the form of slide shows, video clips and diagrams, I didn't see a great deal of day-to-day student interaction with the SMARTboards; they were largely used for information transmission, not interaction. However, when it came time for their class presentations on natural disasters, the Grade 5 students made slide shows using PowerPoint that were surprisingly elegant and information-dense. They weren't needlessly flashy, as sometimes happens when children discover the Transitions section. This was a relief to me, as I sometimes suspect teachers employ the SMARTboard more for its wowing powers than its ability to actually enhance student learning. I believe it was more the Grade 5 teacher's pedagogic style, rather than any specialized knowledge about PowerPoint, that was the main contributing factor leading to these presentations' concision and impact, but students certainly demonstrated a strong overall understanding of this particular form of digital technology and its uses.\n",
      "  I observed Grade 4 and 5 students using laptops and desktops to conduct research (on animals and natural disasters, respectively). They were allowed to use only a few trusted online sources, combined with the books in their classroom and school libraries. While this doesn't resemble the kinds of casual, bar-dispute-resolving research adults conduct on the Internet in their spare time (i.e. where Google isn't off-limits), it does prepare students for a future in the academic world. I wondered for a while where the transition takes place, from teacher-approved websites to free and open research (Safe Search still on, of course) -- and then realized that such a switch would be highly dependent on teachers' (and parents' and administrators') theories of mind and human development, and thus different across multiple settings.\n",
      "  Students did not seem to know the basics of searching (e.g. that common, non-lexical items such as \"the\" and \"of\" could be eliminated, or the existence of Boolean operators). This is something I will definitely teach as a means of fostering multiliteracies in my classroom.\n",
      "  The only use of technology that I would classify as Type II (within this setting) is probably the least impressive. For all the recent fuss over cloud computing, we've already had it for a long time, and it's called e-mail. At Branksome, I saw e-mail being used very effectively to communicate between teachers, from teacher to student (in combination with Blackboard) and from teacher to parent. It was through e-mail that parents found out whether the following day would be a snow day. It was through e-mail that the assistant principal was able to alert all classroom teachers about an unfortunate bathroom incident and implement a sign-out policy in response. It was through Blackboard that students checked to see what their homework was, or conducted pre-class research prep based on links curated by the teacher. The ease and efficiency of this near-instant communication cannot be taken for granted; I have seen other schools where it is not used nearly as effectively.\n",
      "  My major new understanding, after this placement, is that it can take a while before new technologies are used to their maximum. In the meantime, however, pre-existing technologies can be clarified and refined until they are no longer seen as magical, instant life-changing devices, but tools with a distinct form and context. At Branksome Hall, such pre-existing technologies ended up being the ones that were most effectively used, in my opinion.,\n",
      "8,1162,1,  During my practicum, I was placed in a school that was struggling to integrate technology into their classrooms. The school had no Smart Boards, nor any teachers who were exceptionally knowledgeable with technology (at least none that I came across during my conversations in the staff room). Each classroom had a standard set of technology pieces to use: 2-3 computers, projector, document camera, sometimes a scanner. Since it was a school located in the PDSB, there should have been a BYOD policy in effect, but personal devices were still banned from use in the classroom. The students still brought them to school, but were only allowed to use them at recess – and they did. There were only 21 students in my class and there were 7 students who had their own device. Clearly the students wanted to use their devices, but were prohibited from doing so. Another unfortunate shortcoming for the school was their Wi-Fi network. It was installed during my third week, but had not been turned on thereafter. I believe their plan is to use it starting next year. I believe this was a huge loss for the students.\n",
      "  Fortunately, my AT was a little more forward thinking, when it comes to using technology, than the school as a whole. He often has the students working in the lab, at least 4 times a week. He has a few major assignments throughout the year that are made using technology. For example, he uses flip cams and windows movie maker to get the students to make stop motion animation videos. He also has students create and present digital posters as one of their summative tasks. My AT was very open-minded about using technology in the classroom, and he, himself, was very comfortable with various technologies. In fact, he was the one who other teachers turned to for their everyday tech-support needs. My AT also used a lot of technology on a day-to-day basis, not just for occasional assignments and projects. He used the document camera and a computer every day. He showed a lot of videos and often had students working on the classroom computer.\n",
      "  Towards the end of the practicum, I began really analysing his use of technology and how appropriate it was. I wondered whether or not he used them to enrich his pedagogy, or simply as short cuts. For example, during a read aloud, the students suggested I use the document camera instead of circulating the room, like how the AT does it. Personally, I think circulating works better in read alouds for the sake of both classroom management and the experience itself.\n",
      "Towards the end, I concluded that the way my AT used technology was sometimes good and sometimes bad. He incorporated both Type 1 and Type 2 uses of technologies into his program, and that’s how it should be. Sometimes, teachers need to present information to students, and using technology to boost the interest level is appropriate, as long as it doesn’t distract student learning. Furthermore, my AT was working within his means. He used every bit of existing technology as much as possible, and brought in his own pieces too, like cameras, iPod, and a stereo system. The socioeconomic restraints of the student body at the school was another restraint on his ability to use technology. Some students didn’t have internet access at home, so using web-based technologies was a challenge for them, which is why he had them work in the lab as often as he did.\n",
      "  Overall, my experience with the AT was a good one. He was supportive of my attempts to integrate technology. He helped me make a consent letter for parents when I got the students to sign up for Edmodo, and he allowed me to do a workshop for the class on how to use Prezi. Integrating technology was important to him, and I saw him using it the best, and the most, he could. ,\n",
      "8,1163,1,  I was located at Wedgewood Elementary, a K-5 school in TDSB in Etobicoke.  The technology use I observed was reflective of the age.  Cellphone use was prohibited except where carried for emergency use; few students flouted that rule or indicated huge interest in cellphones.  Most students indicated having access to computers at some point, but were not carrying around expensive smartphones.\n",
      "  This was my fourth practicum overall and my third in the TDSB.  My two previous TDSB placements had almost no technology present in the school, and none at all in the classroom.  My YRDSB practicum offered significantly more options as there were resources both within and outside the class, and there were small notebooks which students could use for basic typing work and some basic app access.  This most recent practicum was the first, however, where I had access to a SMART board. Global access through notebooks versus interactive access via a SMART board have different strengths, and if forced to choose I would take global access for older students and the interactive access for the younger.\n",
      "  Many people complain that SMART boards are often used as little more than a glorified whiteboard.  However, so much of the techniques involved in ‘good teaching’ (particularly with younger students) really boil down to managing the class in a way that carves out time for one on one interactions, that manages the flow in a way that students can move seamlessly between activities, and allows for multiple learning styles to access materials.  While in my first month of my use of the SMART board did not go beyond what a good overhead projector with pre-done transparencies could have done alongside a computer, it did allow for it to be done much faster, in one document, and easily referenced and filed.  As such, it did exactly what good pedagogy can do; save time in class for more conferencing time, ease transition times, and enable more media through which students could access the materials.  As such, even discrete uses of the SMART board were helpful despite the fact that I was not harnessing its full capabilities. It also allowed for quick and simple transition between typing and writing things out where appropriate (ie, in math) which computers usually make very difficult.  The “turnkey” solution for lesson planning was tremendously helpful from a teaching point of view, particularly with younger students.\n",
      "  In addition to my own homeroom, I also observed the students in their French class which was not equipped with any technology. As a recent French learner who had the opportunity to access a phonetics lab, I see huge potential in computer use for both native and non-native language improvement.  Although I was impressed with the French teacher and the level the students managed to acquire, there was a definite missed opportunity to leverage technology.  The voice recording options available through a computer or smart phone are significant and could have increased the amount of oral interaction which occurred in the language class.\n",
      "  Overall, this practicum was useful for observing a range of technology uptake and was extremely helpful for undergoing a learning curve with a SMART board and discovering the kind of teacher I can be when I have access to different tools. ,\n",
      "8,1164,1,     The most striking aspect of the technology policies at Voice Intermediate School (VIS) is that they do not explicitly exist. Searching their website yields no evidence of any guidelines concerning the in-school use of technology, nor do students' agendas have any rules listed. This is not a problem, however; since VIS isn't part of the TDSB, it doesn't need to comply with its Online Code of Conduct, or any explicit guidelines concerning technology.\n",
      "  E-mail correspondence with a VIS teacher gave me some additional information: \"VIS doesn't have a written technology policy per se but we do have 'rules' around it\" (quotations are the teacher's, not mine). Those so-called 'rules' are the following:\n",
      "  Students' cellular phones are to be turned off and left in their lockers during the day\n",
      "Each student is required to have a laptop and it is to be used for school purposes only (for notes, projects, etc.)\n",
      "   A related fact:\n",
      "The school currently has three SMARTboards (in the Science, History and Math classrooms) and plans to equip every classroom with one\n",
      "   I had a conversation with my would-be AT about the first guideline and he said that this was not only for the purposes of classroom management but because the brick walls made it difficult enough for teachers' wireless access to the Internet; with cellular phone interference it would be near-impossible. I did not see any students contravening the guideline, and I don't think the absence of their phones made the students anxious or unable to interact with the material.\n",
      "   As for the second rule, I originally felt this was not an inclusive policy, since it presumed that students were uniformly able to follow it. Though the cost of tuition at VIS may suggest that this is the case, I didn't think that it captured the likely reality that there are hidden accessibility issues at play (e.g. students receiving financial aid). However, my AT assured me that students who could not afford laptops were provided with one. I'm not exactly sure of the logistics of this - whether such students kept them permanently or had them only during the course of the school year - but, whatever the case, it took care of the access issue during the school year.\n",
      "   I saw two of the SMARTboards used in the Math and Science classrooms. In the Math class I witnessed, students were sorting products into the various sections of a Venn diagram, certainly extending their learning by being able to virtually manipulate the numbers (instead of having static representations in a textbook). In the Science class, I saw the SMARTboard being used for Google Maps, displaying a video, and for the teacher to scribe notes (to be printed for later use, as exemplars for student note-taking and explication of the scientific method), all of which expanded students' awareness of their world (the Google Map exploration helped with their mapping task, the video enriched their ecosystem unit and the note-taking was a good model of exemplary student behaviour).\n",
      "   I think that, while the technology policy seemed at first to be too broad and casual, it respects junior and intermediate students' burgeoning independence, counting on them to be focused in their use of technology, and to avoid inappropriate behaviour without being told. I don't know how feasible this would be in a larger school, or one with a weaker sense of community, but at VIS it seems to be working.,\n",

During breaks students were allowed to use the computers for games and YouTube videos, as long as no other student needed to use them for school assignments. Teachers required students to print all their assignments – electronic submissions were not accepted. It was possible to book a cart with laptops for almost every student, but the cart needed to be booked in advance and shared with classes from another school. Due to the limited availability and the inability to plan for consistent use of the laptops, teachers did not plan activities which required students to use them during class. During my time there I have not seen the laptop cart in use. Teachers occasionally used computers for presentations, but projectors in the school were not always working and wireless internet was very inconsistent. As a result, most presentations were done using overheads.\n",
      "I think the limited access to technology had a negative impact on student learning. At times teaching and learning became overly reliant on pen and paper, which was problematic for some students and boring for others. Students had already been using Google documents, so teachers could have provided feedback directly on the electronic document (via sharing) rather than requiring printing and providing han written comments. Presentations through overhead were not as interactive and not as clear as computer based presentations, and I generally found them more difficult to prepare.,\n",
