# Cognitive Engagement 
This repo includes the source code that we used for data preprocessing and training classification models for cognitive engagement prediction. 
We labelled the data based on the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive engagement framework (ICAP; Chi & Wylie, 2014)and then trained classifiers to evaluate the feasibility of automating the cognitive engagement prediction in online discussion posts. 
The analysis were conducted in Python (version 3.8.8).
